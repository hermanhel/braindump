* Method
I used the ~build.py~ and ~ninja~ approach and copyed ~publish.el~ most from 
[[https://github.com/jethrokuan/braindump/][Jethro's Braindump]].
The build.py didn't work for me, so I borrowed from system crafter's org website tutorial the way to build: instead of a complete ~init.el~, I used a minimal ~init.el~ to do the work.
