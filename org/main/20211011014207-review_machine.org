#+title: Review Machine
#+HUGO_SECTION:main
This machine is for review of everything worth look back on in a 1d, 7d, 14d, 30d cycle.
* Flow
** 1. Record
Record the content worth reviewing by hitting ~C-c c (org-capture)~ and ~r(review)~.
Record the summary and resource/notes for review.
Records would be kept in  ~OrgNotes/Review.org~
** 2. Review
Go to ~OrgNotes/Review.org~, and run command ~org-review~[fn:1]. A sparse tree showing the items would be automatically generated.
The log of the reviewing should be done seperately in every entry (C-c C-x i/o)

* Footnotes

[fn:1]: a self written function taking advantage of the ~date~ shell command and ~datetree~ option in org-capture.
