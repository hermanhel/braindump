* Learning
I've been thinking if I should nest the topic under project, or stand alone.
Plus, or under different aspects of artist, like writer/drawer
** Writing
*** Franklin Method
1. Take a paragraph.
2. Write it.
3. Compare to the original one.
** Drawing
*** Workflow Speci
The WorkFolder is under ~~/Ultra Projects/Ultra Draw/Drawabox~
*** Drawabox
Drawabox is a website with a bunch of progressive drills and concepts about drawing
After trying it, I think it's a very good progress line to follow.
I'm taking a drawabox exercise each day before doing anything to remember the grinding work of life.
**** Process
***** TODO Boxes
*** Other Drills
**** Copy Machine
**** Drafting (exclusive)
** Model
Using Blender
** Jazz Piano
Jazz Piano!

** Sing
* Aspects
** Jazz piano
*** Tutorial(my)
**** Section 1: the composition
Jazz piano is not self completing. To play good jazz piano, you need to play at least 1 other instrumment. Bass, Harp, and Guitar are usually popular choices. Drum is not always a popular second instrument, but it's also a good one.

One reason you need another instrument is that Jazz music is of interaction. Piano's having very unique logic, you need to understand other instrument. A good way is to play one.

Another good reason is that, piano's logic is kind of disguising. You could play 7 or 8 notes together, all the sounds, without knowing them. A Bass, on the other hand, plays only base and its own solo, Harp too. The switch of logic provide comparison that could guide you to avoid unconscious playing, and make things more fun.

**** Besame Mucho
***** Lyrics
bésame, bésame mucho,

como si fuera esta noche la última vez,

bésame, bésame mucho,

que tango miedo a perderte perderte después

bésame, bésame mucho,

como si fuera esta la última vez,

bésame, bésame mucho,

que tango miedo a perderte, perderte después

quiero tenerte muy cerca mirarme en tus ojos verte junto a mí

piensa que tal vez mañana yo ya estaré lejos, muy lejos deti

bésame, bésame mucho

como si fuera esta noche la última vez.

bésame, bésame mucho

que tango miedo a perderte, perderte después

**** Hotel California
***** Lyrics
On a dark desert highway

Cool wind in my hair

Warm smell of colitas

Rising up through the air

Up ahead in the distance

I saw a shimmering light

my head grew heavy and my sight grew dim

I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway

I heard the mission bell

ANd I was thinking to myself this could be heaven or this could be hell

Then she lit up a candle

And she showed me the way.

There were voices down the corridor,

I thought I head them say 
**** Sweet Vitory
