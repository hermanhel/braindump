** Textbook
   /Computer Systems Architecture: A Networking Approach./ by Rob Williams
   I have a copy of it. This is the mandatory textbook.
** Lecture Slides
   Lecture slides are often released a week before.
   The professor would be covering the exact content of the slids.
   Maybe base of Exams.
*** Week 5
