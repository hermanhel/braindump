** Textbook
   /Computer Systems Architecture: A Networking Approach./ by Rob Williams
   I have a copy of it. This is the mandatory textbook.
** Lecture Slides
   Lecture slides are often released a week before.
   The professor would be covering the exact content of the slids.
   Maybe base of Exams.
** Online Resources
   I would say MIT OCW definitely have courses under the topic.

   I don't know most things about CPT107. That's not right for a module I enrolled in, a great university student enrolled in. Fix that.
   The Approach is:
   1. I go to course page
   2. I find credit information
   3. I find Professor information
   4. I find course content information
   5. I find module specific information
      like =the server the module is using, delivery plan, classroom=
