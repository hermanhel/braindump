* Using MySQL Server
** Emacs
I Think that I'll be using this approach mainly. Check that out.
*** Using eshell
#+begin_src shell
 mysql -h [server] -u [usrname] -p # RET, then input the passward
#+end_src
*** Using sql-MySQL
1. Edit a .sql file
2. M-x sql-MySQL
3. usrname, password, database, server.
**** Error: cannot find mysqlo
** TODO phpMyAdmin
