* Problem/sul.
** 32-bit libs.
sometimes when =./xxx= report no such file when there actually was. That could be caused by lack of 32-bit lib when under a 64-bit system.

Solution is download respectively the missing libs by =yum install libstdc++.i686=, where libstdc++ replaced by the lib. The =.i686= stands for the 32-bit version of the lib.
** back running
use =screen= command.
=screen= to start a screen, C-a-d to leave, =screen -r= to recovera
