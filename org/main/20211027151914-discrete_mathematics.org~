#+title: Discrete Mathematics
* Number Systems
** Natural Numbers
*** Closed under addtition
any 2 num in N add get 1 num in N
*** Key property
Any natural number can be obtained from 0
by S(n) = n + 1
S(0) = 1, S(S(0) = 2; =induction= !!
** Integers
and negative
*** Even and odd
0 = undefined
** Rational Numbers
x/y where x and y belong to Integers
** Real numbers
all decimal numbers
Distances to points on a number line
** Prinme Numbers

** Perrin Numbers
* Proof Techiniques
** Proof by Induction

*** Flow
**** 1. Bace Case
property holds for n = 0
**** 2. Inductive Step
n = m ==> n = m + 1
**** 3. Conclusion

** Contradiction

*** Flow

**** 1. Assumption by contradiction

**** 2. Develop the proof

**** 3. Find self conflict
