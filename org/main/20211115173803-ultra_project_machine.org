*** Rules
**** Rule 1: Don't give up on Hard Problems Easily             :principle:
Feynman hand calculate forces, so as to understand them better.

could use a struggle timer, like 30 minutes
+ Pro
  + Sometimes it just need a little more thinking
  + Retrieving non-existing info, make remember easier
**** Rule 2: Prove things to Understand Them                   :principle:
Understanding is to re-create the results
**** Rule 3: Always start with a concrete example              :principle:
**** Rule 4: Don't fool yourself                               :principle:
我可以分辨我是否知道一个东西,是否发现了一个东西.我不愚弄自己来让自己感觉良好.我接受现实.
