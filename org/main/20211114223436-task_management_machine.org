* Next Task
All tasks are stored in the =TODO= task list.(with =TODO= heading prefix)

Among them, choose 5-6 to be focused in a few sessions, like a day or two. They are the =NEXT= tasks. Upon choosing, change their prefix to =NEXT=, and they will be displayed in the dashboard's NEXT tasks area.
** Add =NEXT= tasks
*** 1. Emergency
When some task needed to be dealt with immediately, add them to =NEXT= tasks.
*** 2. Running out
can treat every few =NEXT= tasks like a sprint. Select 5-6 tasks =NEXT=, and that's the sprint, and after all 5-6 tasks are done, the sprint's over.

Then, choose another 5-6 tasks.
