   Could use the approach in [[file:20211007013423-cpt107.org::*Course information][Course information]]. Could make a machine out of that.

  I would say with pity that I'm left behind a little bit in the course.
  The content would definitely be in my range, but I still have to learn them to have them, and I need to be reliable and at least following the module's schedule.
  The Approach is:
  1. I read a tutorial
  2. I write paper note
  3. I do exercise
  4. I write org-roam node [[id:DC5167CD-BFBC-4DE3-8B89-7E1ABFCA6433][SQL]]
  5. I go back to exercises.

  It's worth mention that this could be a reuseable machine for self-learning of other similar skills.
  For this task, do as this flow. In the future, could test on other flows like =that without paper note=
