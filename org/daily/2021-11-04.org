Instead of what I thought I am--a brave explorer--I'm afraid of unfamilliar things, and is sick about them.

*** [#A] Mind too blind, urge and lifeless, instead of calm and outsider as it should be
I should be able to watch my deeds from out side, checking my background sound principles all the time, confirming of every movements if they converge to the principles and noting them.
[[*always forget to exercise in the middle of day][always forget to exercise in the middle of day]]
*** Easy Perished interest. and ignorance of the relation of the tasks to the Goals
[[*Resist hard work][Resist hard work]]
[[*Casually have no energy to do anything][Casually have no energy to do anything]]

*** [#A] My passion of performing a strategy.
It could be a double-edged sword.
I'm really fascinated by the idea of performing a strategy, like that in LOL, other games, reading novels(click to next page), masturbating--all the stuff that I don't really know what will be the result, but I have a image of it, whether it's totally imaginary or empirical.
The idea of having a prediction of future, and act to realize it caught me.

That's also source of my interest of learning how to write every sound and paragraph I see. I want to be able to make everything I senced. That's what I say when I refer to [[id:F1E6F424-6DD8-462A-B2C3-AD0EE8CD579F][Artist]] and [[id:9C7D0D76-725F-45D6-B84A-4F75C11E164F][Engineer]].

This relationship is worth examine and use.

also, it contributes to my resistence to things I'm not familiar with, with no paradigm or principle to follow.

*** [#A] Little care of what's being done & Genius worship
I have little care of my work and deeds, the things I figured out.

That's the cause of myself not reviewing or practicing anything or acting with my principles.

Such might trace back to my [[id:F75715D4-D30D-416A-85D3-E348755F9755][Genius worship]].

I think that all things happened to me will stick forever, because I'm a genius. Same worship to muscle memory also exist, that I should practice something to muscle memory and it sticks forever.

Truth is the odd of it happening second time is the odd they have happened before: 1 time in 18 years, or 10 times in a week. This is a usage of the tradition.

Meanwhile, such worship also stands for my almightiness, that I could finish everything within a tap.

Truth is that I could do anything but not everything. Time is never enough, and is critical.

*** [#A] Too much concern on the way others see me--Low self-esteem

low self-esteem seem to be a major cause.
I don't want others look down on me, don't want them think me as a lazy, stupid, unprofesstional, ignorant, foolish kid, though I really am one.

I fear the true nature of myself, while worshiping beatiful characteristics, like 007's professional skills and style, like being on principles. I convince myself that these natures are all inside me in the distance of one call.

It's true that they are one call far. But if I don't call, they won't be present, due to the distance, and the reality of my true nature. I know the strategy and the image, but not the reality. I hate this reality, so I'm not looking it.

I should not be caring of others opinions about me. These are going to change anyway, my goals, on the other hand, would stick. I now know the strategy. I'm dying to see the image.

[[*fear to communicate with others(teacher or fellow student) when left behind][fear to communicate with others(teacher or fellow student) when left behind]]

*** [#A] Focus too nervous
Could be due to [[*Too much concern on the way others see me--Low self-esteem][Too much concern on the way others see me--Low self-esteem]].
I'm easy to get nervous instead of excited and relax.

The examples is the tension on my forehead. Such tension will come up when ever I want to focus, especially when reading not familiar texts like English or Math, or Academic things.

I'm forced to raise my forhead tension, reading out, getting nervous on not familiar things. New songs could be another example. I could do much more dynamic and steady flow on an old song of mine but only squeezed scream on new songs.

Gotta be relaxed. especially for focus.

I can't give up anything.

Things become valuable when I reexamine them and throw out some.
