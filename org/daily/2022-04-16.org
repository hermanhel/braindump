Journey: server? - server! - vm! - deploy! - connected!
? for concept/explaination, ! for practice
*** Server?
**** machine and program
word =server= is refered to program handling request and machine on which the program runs.
+ server machine: a packed MacBook Pro with macOS BigSur
+ program: a programming constantly running on the MacBook Pro, to handle requests.
***** journey of request
1. click [[http://www.communitypicks.com/][http://www.communitypicks.com/]]
2. browser: figure out IP address and send a HTTP request
3. machine: recieve request, route the request to a server program it's running
   1. nginx listen to port 80. get request
   2. nging forward request to clojure program listing at port 3000
***** how the machine knows?
port.
1 machine can host many servers, like an office could settle many employees.
By port one request find a correct employee providing certain service, like mail, ssh, etc
http use port 80.

program listening to port 80 would get the request routed by the machine.
=nginx= listen to port 80. apache is another
***** 
*** Server!
**** structure
an example to manage role-playing character sheets
+ front-end: cljs
+ back-end HTTP component
**** flow of information

*** vm!
=vagrant up=  to start
=vagrant halt= to stop
=vagrant destory -f= to destroy everything. =up= again will recreate everything
* After I'll do some CPT104 work.
Now it's afterrrrrrrrr!!!!!!
I'll do my CPT104 work.
Let me...... Go through the whole book!
using 
* highlight website
* Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective
good book
* 我晕了.
我看了一会儿沙雕频道,然后晕了.以后看沙雕频道一次最多看2条,之后就做其他事.不然会晕.
* 晕的处理措施
晕的状态下是不能自制的.不太能做需要强自制力的动作.需要有趣且主动、创造性强的活动.同时是不导致晕的活动.晕会是在不能够控制的活动中产生,比如看不懂得书,只能复述之类的.
