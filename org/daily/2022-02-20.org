* Today's Plan
** DONE Get to know the modules
CLOSED: [2022-04-29 Fri 15:14]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "NEXT"       [2022-04-29 Fri 15:14]
:END:
*** Goal
To accomplish good grade in the modules.

Thus, the system of the module content should be examined, the system of university's deliver/teaching should be documented for further use, and a system of me with my own part and use of university's system to know about the module content system should be established.
**** requirement
3 systems are to be established. Each will in form of a machine.
+ Document Module Content System(MCS)
  name: (CPT102-MCS)
  Full of object/goals. Lack action/flow/principle
+ Document University Teaching System(UTS)
  name: (CPT102-UTS)
  Will include schedule, resource, people to contact to.
  With defined APIs.
  Would imply some methods.
+ Establish and Document Personal Acquisition System(PAS)
  name: (CPT102-PAS)
  Should include Princiople, Actions.
  Goal fits the goals in MCS.
  Use API from UTS wisely.
*** Actions

*** Log
I made decisions on what to do to make MCS,UTS,PAS settled.

Maybe I should reexamine these 3 systems in a while.

The ultimate result of the 3 systems should be data in data structures.

Reading irrelevent material(for current task). Should just skip for now

I first decided to spend 1 hour on each subject, but it seems to short. I spend 2 hour on 1 MCS. So I guess that's the real speed.

2 module each day. 2 hour for MCS, 0.5 hour for UTS.
