Atom habits is a book with 4 laws which:
+ treat habit as atoms, that impact on each other to form moleculars
+ works as atoms that seperately influence the process of habit forming
+ tackle 4 atomic period of the process of doing a thing, to make it a habit, or make it not a habit.
** The 4 phases of the process in sight of habit. (continuous feedback loop)
*** 1.cue
~phone buzz~
*** 2.craving
~"who messaged?"~
*** 3.response(take action to the crave)
~checking who messaged~
*** 4.reward
~sovled the probelm and happy.~
** The power of =atomic= habit
*** 1. Massive action vs. 1% improvement
=the 1% improvement rules=
success is product of =daily progress=, and not =once-in-a-life action=
*** 2. truth of progress.

[[/Users/hermanhe/Notes/RoamNotes/daily/progresstruth.png]]
*** 3. goals and systems
Forget about the goals, focus on the =systems= instead
+ goals: the abstract outcome, result, like /get fit/
+ systems: the process that get you to the actual result

connecting with [[id:B92A7F7E-2E72-4816-917C-2A8CCBD6EEC8][5-step-analysis]] , where the goals are put forwarded first, but as a must followed by 4 other steps which refine the machine/system of accomplishing the goal.

#+begin_quote
Goals -> direction
Systems -> making progress
#+end_quote
*** 4. atomic habits are the building block of remarkable result
*** 5. 3 layers of bahaviour change
1. outcome
   the result, the goal, the actual consequence
2. process
   [[id:BE1A7182-CCEC-4722-BAC6-70E67337C2F6][Machine]]s
3. identity
   role in [[id:1130F0BE-A5C1-4E0F-8AF7-9BC582111108][Roles]].
  like [[id:BCAC2B73-634A-4A49-8962-40CC2DF03751][Athlete]]
*** 6. habit loop
habit is formed with repeated small session every day, each session formed with [[The 4 phases of the process in sight of habit. (continuous feedback loop)][continous feedback loop]]
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 900
[[/Users/hermanhe/Notes/RoamNotes/daily/habitloop.png]]
over time, =Chain= formed between =cue= and =reward=
** The 4 laws
*** 1. Make it =obvious=
**** 1. Habit score card
1. list all behaviours
2. mark =+=, =-=, ===, for positive, negative, and neutral
**** 2. set Time and location
~I will _behaviour_ at _time_ in _this location_.~
I will read at 6 p.m on my desk.

use a cue to trigger the habit. the cue should be something you do automatically without failing.
**** 3. Habit stacking
~After doing _current habit_, I will _new habit_.~
after _brushing my teeth, I'll strech for 5 minutes.
**** 4. Environment vs. Motivation
context is the cue.
think: the house full with +object+ =relations=
I relax on my bed. I work on my desk
one space, one use
***** 1. make cue for good habit more easy to be seen
place bottle in the house -> drink more
place book in the house -> read more
***** 2. make cue for bad habits invisible 
*** 2. Make it =attractive=
**** 1. dopamine spikes
+ Dopamine spikes in =craving=
  when a drug addicter =sees= drug.
+ The =craving= causes us to =take action=
  the drug addicter =uses= drug after.
**** 2. temptation bundling
premack's principle: more prabable behaviors promote less prabable behaviors
**** 3. group influence
into a culture where the habit is norm
**** 4. primitive =motives= -> source of craving
=the habits are modern-day solution to ancient desires=
**** 5. reprogram the brain to accept hard habits
Make the hard habits attractive by accosiating them with a positive experiance
+ highlight the =benifit=
  fitness = =wellbeing= +fatigue+
**** 6. Make bad habit unattractive
*** 3. Make it easy
**** 1. habit is framed in terms of number of repetitions
+time+
**** 2. Reducing Friction: law of least effort
read 1 page of book every day
**** 3. Prime the environment for use
Prepare the environment before.
**** 4. use 2-minute rule to stop procrastinating
just, 2-minute version of the habit.
target: anchor the repetition
consequence: sometimes the motivation of completion arrive after the start.
**** 5. make bad habit impractical as possible
*** 4. Make it satisfying
**** 1. The most important rule
Satisfaction after the action promote =repetition=
"This feels good, let's do it for another time"
What is immediately rewarded is repeated, what is immediately punished, is avoided
**** 2. Immediate/long-term award/punish
adding little pleasure to long-run benefit, and pain to the long-run bad habit
**** 3. Rewarding yourself and feeling succesful
Use little wins, like a progress bar, a jar of marble, paper clip,
**** 4. visual measurements
logs, pagenumbers, journals...
**** 5. Habit track
**** 6. when bad days come......
=Don't break the chain!=
do the small version, just don't break the chain.
**** 7. Habit contract.
claims clear that you will honor a particular habit and that there will be punishments if you do not
** Method
1. set target HABIT, and GOOD? to signify if it's a good habit.
2. for each phase of habit loop, take corresponding action to push the habit to a direction of:
   + obvious - invisible (for cue)
   + attractive - unattractive (for craving)
   + easy - hard (for responsing)
   + satisfying/pleasure - unsatisfying/painful (for reward)
3. Set mindset(background sound/principle/belief/viewpoint)
   + like, when developing work out habit:
     + thinking that 1% improvement rules
     + thinking that showing up's half the bottle
     + thinking that from the 3 layers, I identity myself as an athelete
     + knowing that I'm probably in the valley of disappointment, so be patient.
       it's not a decision-result correspondency, but a viewpoint with respect of fact. It's a cognition, a thinking and evaluation with no interacting with the world, not changing the facts, no engineering, but by making evaluation of myself to certain realistic standards, I gain a cirtain emotion mode, which impact my feeling, action, motivation, crave, and reward(satisfacition.)

+ - Watching funny videos too much
+ - Watching movie/shows too much
+ bad body stance(low chest and neck)
** The Good habits I want to develop
*** + coding(to a book/a problem I encounter)
**** Cue - obvious
+ Habit stack: I'll start coding, Right after I take my morning dump. I could use toilet time to think/deside what to do
+ environment: I ahve ACP side of my desk.
**** Craving - attractive
+ Reprogramming the brain
  + the benefit of improving my coding skill:
    1. I'll be more capable in engineering.
    2. I'll be powerful
    3. People would admire me
    4. I'll have a lot of fun in programming and engineering a system
    5. It'll enable me to eventually build my baby AI
    6. The whole thing of coding/engineering would be more clear to me, instead of vague and frustrating mistery
+ Temptation bundling
  After I've done a session of coding, I'll practice a knot
**** Response - easy
+ least effort:
  I just have to code for 1 session to whatever material at hand.
  It could be from the /Hands-on intro to ML/ book, or a projectEuler challenge, or a random program from my todo list, anything would be suffice
+ Prime the environment:
  Choose a coding task before I went to toilet, and open the file I needed.
+ Use a 2-minuet version:
  Do 2-minute coding first if procrastinate. But I doubt if I will.
**** Reward - satisfying
+ Adding little pleasure
  After the session, tie a knot.
  They are both engineering & art
+ Habit track
  Make a subtree coding in Engineering, style habit. Each day ofter the 1 session, set it marked.
+ Habit contract
  In the heading, make declaims
+ Visual measurements
  log every thing done. Round thing up
**** Mindset - continue process
+ I'm a hacker
+ 1% improvement a day.
+ showing up's half the bottle
*** read Don quijote
**** Cue - obvious
+ Time and place
  ~I will read 1 page of Don Quijote with all words and usages figured out at 4 p.m. at my desk~
+ I have my yellow grammar book on my desk
**** Craving - attractive
+ Reprogramming the brain
  + the benefit of improving my coding skill
    1. I'll be better in spanish
    2. I could really understand what Cervantes have to say, these spirits.
    3. I could recite the classic lines to impress other people
    4. I could reference these very good lines in my own speaking
+ Temptation bundling
  After I've done a 1 page, I'll read it aloud
**** Response - easy
+ Least effort:
  1 page a day
+ The environmnet:
  The book, Emacs/org-roam/don-quijote for note, Esdict/Collins for reference. 
**** Reward - satisfying

  A knot after the page
**** Mindset - continue process
+ 1% improvement
+ I'm a writer
*** + Do projectEuler challenges
*** + drink hot water regularly
*** + eat my mom's cooking
*** + Get up early
*** + Running
*** + take a dump
but quickly
*** + Take class
*** Work out(with a plan and every in a while)
*** Find in my threads for tasks in leisure
*** Do every session with accordence to the [[id:E48DECC9-A139-4F6D-B6F6-62B3570959D6][General task doing machine]]
*** Read every book with speed reading skill
*** Make big projects
*** Self-learn neuroscience.
*** self-learn Machine learning.
