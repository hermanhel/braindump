This braindump is a direct follow up to [[https://braindump.jethro.dev/][Jethro Kuan's braindump]]. Though I did it simpler, while he used emacs, python and ninja to build the website, I used only emacs script, which [sync everything using /list-rsync/ to this repo](not yet, I didn't write the ~list-rsync-all-to-dest DEST~ yet), use ~ox-hugo~ to produce the ~content~ folder (the function ~hermanhel/braindump-publish~ is almost identical to ~jethro/publish~, I made some small changes.) and borrowed his hugo theme.

Also, the build methodlogy including github actions and ~./build.sh~ are adopted from [[https://systemcrafters.cc/][system crafters]]'s [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfkrzFodoNw&t=1513s#0][org-mode website tutorial]].
