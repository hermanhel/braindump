  abstract = {Every experience, those we are aware of and those we are not, is embedded in a subjective timeline, is tinged with emotion, and inevitably evokes a certain sense of self. Here, we present a phenomenological model for consciousness and selfhood which relates time, awareness, and emotion within one framework. The consciousness state space (CSS) model is a theoretical one. It relies on a broad range of literature, hence has high explanatory and integrative strength, and helps in visualizing the relationship between different aspects of experience. Briefly, it is suggested that all phenomenological states fall into two categories of consciousness, core and extended (CC and EC, respectively). CC supports minimal selfhood that is short of temporal extension, its scope being the here and now. EC supports narrative selfhood, which involves personal identity and continuity across time, as well as memory, imagination and conceptual thought. The CSS is a phenomenological space, created by three dimensions: time, awareness and emotion. Each of the three dimensions is shown to have a dual phenomenological composition, falling within CC and EC. The neural spaces supporting each of these dimensions, as well as CC and EC, are laid out based on the neuroscientific literature. The CSS dynamics include two simultaneous trajectories, one in CC and one in EC, typically antagonistic in normal experiences. However, this characteristic behavior is altered in states in which a person experiences an altered sense of self. Two examples are laid out, flow and meditation. The CSS model creates a broad theoretical framework with explanatory and unificatory power. It constructs a detailed map of the consciousness and selfhood phenomenology, which offers constraints for the science of consciousness. We conclude by outlining several testable predictions raised by the CSS model.},

  date = {2013},

  abstract = {The author proposes a holoinformational view of consciousness based on the holonomic theory of brain function and quantum brain dynamics developed by Karl Pribram, Sir John Eccles, Hameroff, Jibu and Yasue, and on the quantum-holographic and holomovement theory of David Bohm. This conceptual framework is integrated to the non-local information property of the Quantum Field Theory of Umesawa, the concept of negentropy, order, and organization developed by Shannon, Wiener, Szilard and Brillouin, and to theories of self-organization and complexity of Prigogine, Atlan, and Jantsch. Wheeler’s “it from bit” concept of a participatory universe, and the developments of the physics of information made by Zurek and others with the concepts of statistical entropy and algorithmic entropy, related to the number of bits being processed in the mind of the observer, are also considered. This new synthesis gives a self-organizing quantum-holographic non-local informational basis for a transpersonal model of consciousness in a participatory universe. In this synthesis, consciousness is conceived as quantum non-local significant information interconnecting the brain and the cosmos by means of a holoinformational field, with a nonlocal/quantum holistic component interconnecting mind and cosmos, and a local/Newtonian mechanistic component interconnecting brain and mind. This non-local quantum-holographic cosmos manifests itself through a quantum-holographic transpersonal consciousness, interconnecting in a participatory holistic and indivisible way the human brain to all levels of the universe.},

  abstract = {In recent years, counterfeiting has grown exponentially and has now become a grave economic problem. The acquisition of counterfeits poses an ethical dilemma as it benefits the buyer and illegal seller at the cost of the legitimate producer and with fewer taxes being paid throughout the supply chain. Previous research reveals inconsistent and sometimes inconclusive findings regarding whether materialism is associated, positively or negatively, with intentions to purchase counterfeits. The current research seeks to resolve these inconsistencies by investigating previously ignored interactions between three variables: risk of embarrassment, counterfeit detectability and product conspicuousness. First, risk of embarrassment mediates the relationship between materialism and counterfeit purchase intentions. Specifically, materialism negatively predicts counterfeit purchase intentions as mediated by risk of embarrassment. Second, this relationship only holds when the counterfeit can be easily detected. When it is not easily detected, materialism instead leads to positive purchase intentions. Third, these positive effects can be offset when the product is not highly visible. This research has important implications for marketers, manufacturers and academics and contributes to better understanding the antecedents of counterfeit purchases.},

  abstract = {Acquisition and purchase of counterfeit and pirated products are illicit and morally questionable consumer behaviors. Nonetheless, some consumers engage in such illicit behavior and seem to overcome the moral dilemma by justification strategies. The findings on morality effects on consumer responses to counterfeit and pirated products are diverse, and the underlying theories provide no clear picture of the process that explains how morality and justification lead to particular consumer responses or why consumers differ in their responses. This study presents a meta-analysis of 788 effect sizes from 207 independent samples provided in 196 manuscripts that synthesizes the research on the influence of morality on attitudes, intentions, and behavior toward counterfeit and pirated products. The meta-analysis tests competing theoretical models that describe the morality-justification processes, and identifies the deontological-teleological model as the superior one. The meta-analysis further shows that the institutional and social context of consumers explains the differences in morality effects on justifications and responses to counterfeit and pirated products, and provides evidence for the context-sensitivity of the underlying theories.},

Consumers are willing to pay more for counterfeits than for generic merchandise of similar quality because they value the prestige associated with brand-name trademarks. Counterfeiters of status goods impose a negative externality on consumers of genuine items, as fakes degrade the status associated with a given label. But counterfeits allow consumers to unbundle the status and quality attributes of the brand-name products, and alter the competition among oligopolistic trademark owners. We analyze two policies designed to combat counterfeiting: enforcement policy which increases the likelihood of confiscation of illegal items, and the imposition of a tariff on low-quality imports.},

  abstract = {A fully autonomous intracranial device is built to continually record neural activities in different parts of the brain, process these sampled signals, decode features that correlate to behaviors and neuropsychiatric states, and use these features to deliver brain stimulation in a closed-loop fashion. In this paper, we describe the sampling and stimulation aspects of such a device. We first describe the signal processing algorithms of two unsupervised spike sorting methods. Next, we describe the LFP time-frequency analysis and feature derivation from the two spike sorting methods. Spike sorting includes a novel approach to constructing a dictionary learning algorithm in a Compressed Sensing (CS) framework. We present a joint prediction scheme to determine the class of neural spikes in the dictionary learning framework; and, the second approach is a modified OSort algorithm which is implemented in a distributed system optimized for power efficiency. Furthermore, sorted spikes and timefrequency analysis of LFP signals can be used to generate derived features (including cross-frequency coupling, spike-field coupling). We then show how these derived features can be used in the design and development of novel decode and closed-loop control algorithms that are optimized to apply deep brain stimulation based on a patient’s neuropsychiatric state. For the control algorithm, we define the state vector as representative of a patient’s impulsivity, avoidance, inhibition, etc. Controller parameters are optimized to apply stimulation based on the state vector’s current state as well as its historical values. The overall algorithm and software design for our implantable neural recording and stimulation system uses an innovative, adaptable, and reprogrammable architecture that enables advancement of the state-of-the-art in closed-loop neural control while also meeting the challenges of system power constraints and concurrent development with ongoing scientific research designed to define brain network connectivity and neural network dynamics that vary at the individual patient level and vary over time.},

When learning to achieve multiple goals, data efficiency is intimately connected with generalization of the Q-function to new goals. The de-facto paradigm is to approximate Q(s, a, g) using monolithic neural networks. To improve generalization of the Q-function, we propose a bilinear decomposition that represents the Q-value via a low-rank approximation in the form of a dot product between two vector fields. The first vector field, f (s, a), captures the environment’s local dynamics at the state s; whereas the second component, φ(s, g), captures the global relationship between the current state and the goal. We show that our bilinear decomposition scheme substantially improves data efficiency, and has superior transfer to out-of-distribution goals compared to prior methods. Empirical evidence is provided on the simulated Fetch robot task-suite, and dexterous manipulation with a Shadow hand.},

The problem of counterfeiting is harmful to economic growth and well being of countries and companies. However, this study primarily focused on the issue of counterfeit product purchases from the consumers' viewpoint. For example, using Theory of planned behavior (TPB), consumers' counterfeit purchase intention is judged based on three important factors such as Perceived risk, Word of mouth, and Emotions. Using nonprobability convenience sampling technique, a self-administrated questionnaire was designed and distributed among 500 respondents in Islamabad, Lahore and Peshawar city of Pakistan. Out of the total, only (n = 214, 42.8\%) questionnaires were completed and retrieved from the respondents. Pearson correlation and General linear model statistical test are applied to examine and interpret the collected data. Results show that, except perceived risk, the word of mouth and emotions positively influence consumers' counterfeit products purchase intentions. The results are of great importance for the business sector as well as to policy makers for hostility against the counterfeit trading, selling, promotion and purchasing in developing countries.},

Today BMIs designed for both experimental and clinical studies can translate raw neuronal signals into motor commands that reproduce arm reaching and hand grasping movements in artificial actuators. Clearly, these developments hold promise for the restoration of limb mobility in paralyzed subjects. However, as we review here, before this goal can be reached several bottlenecks have to be passed. These include designing a fully implantable biocompatible recording device, further developing real-time computational algorithms, introducing a method for providing the brain with sensory feedback from the actuators, and designing and building artificial prostheses that can be controlled directly by brain-derived signals. By reaching these milestones, future BMIs will be able to drive and control revolutionary prostheses that feel and act like the human arm.},

Findings show differences in the factors (and weight thereof) impacting attitude and purchase intention in the two product contexts. Specifically, ethical obligation and perceived risk are found to be significant predictors of attitude towards both symbolic and counterfeit products, while price consciousness is found to predict only attitude towards experiential products, but not purchase intention in either counterfeit product context.},

Additionally, the authors investigate the moderating role of brand image and social interaction and assess their influence on counterfeit quality purchase intentions. A self-administered questionnaire was designed, and data were collected via mall intercepts among consumers who have exposure to counterfeit products. Hierarchical regression model was used to test the proposed hypotheses. The results from regression analysis revealed that the quality of counterfeits not only impacts purchase intentions but also proceeds as a determinant of consumer involvement with imitative products. The results also show that brand image of genuine products negatively moderates the counterfeit product quality-involvement relationship. Social interaction positively moderates the relationship between counterfeit quality and purchase intentions, nonetheless has a negative moderating effect on the link between product involvement and purchase intentions. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {Purpose Most of the past studies have considered social and personal factors in relation to counterfeit product purchase intention. However, there is a dearth of research that linked ethical aspects with such kind of product purchase intention. Considering this gap, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the direct as well as indirect effect of ethical aspects on the attitude of consumers’ counterfeit product purchase in the Malaysian market. Design/methodology/approach A total of 737 questionnaires were distributed in China Town, Low Yat Plaza, as well as a few “pasar malam” (night markets), which yielded 400 completed usable responses. Partial Least Square Smart PLS software and SPSS were utilised in order to analyse the data. Findings The results revealed that the ethical aspect in term of religiosity, ethical concern, and perception of lawfulness directly and indirectly affect consumers’ behavioural intention to purchase counterfeit products. Practical implications It is expected that the study findings will enhance the understanding of marketers as well as policymakers about consumers’ purchase intention of such fake products. Eventually, it will help them to come up with better marketing strategies to purchase counterfeit products and to encourage them to purchase the original product. Originality/value This is relatively a pioneer study that examines the effect of ethical aspects of consumers in term of their religiosity, ethical concern, and perception of lawfulness on their attitude towards buying counterfeit products. Additionally, this study examines the mediating role of consumer attitude to purchase counterfeit product between ethical aspects and behavioural intention, which is comparatively new to the existing body of knowledge. Last, but not the least, this research has examined these relationships in a new research context i.e., Malaysian market, which can advance the knowledge about consumer behaviour in the East Asian context.},

It affects not only products whose brand name is synonymous with its quality or flavour, but also products which require a high level of research and development, and marketing. Counterfeit merchandise cuts into profits and harms the brand owner′s reputation. To be effective in eradicating counterfeiting, one also has to understand the consumer′s propensity to purchase counterfeit products. Challenges the prevalent assumption that price is the main motive for purchasing counterfeit products. Offers conceptualizations of eight possible non‐price determinants of consumers′ behavioural intention towards the purchase of counterfeit products. Uses established scale development procedures to create multi‐item scales for these non‐price constructs. Explores the explanatory role of these constructs by relating them to purchase intention responses for four common counterfeit consumer products, through multiple regression analyses. A convenience survey of consumers in a South‐East Asian city with a pattern of use of counterfeit goods provides data for this study. Results suggest that non‐price determinants, particularly those relating to perceived product attributes and attitude towards counterfeiting, affect consumers′ intention to purchase counterfeit products. The type and magnitude of influence of these, however, differ across products as well as individuals. Discusses implications for branded goods marketers and policy makers.},

  abstract = {Infiltration of leukocytes is one of the hallmarks of the inflammatory response. Among the leukocyte populations, neutrophils are the first to infiltrate, followed by monocytes and lymphocytes, suggesting the presence of mediators that specifically recruit these cell types. Cytokine-like chemoattractants with monocyte chemotactic activity, such as lymphocyte-derived chemotactic factor (LDCF) or tumor-derived chemotactic factor (TDCF), were reported as molecules that could play a critical role in the recruitment of monocytes into sites of immune responses or tumors; however, their identities remained unclear. In the 1980s, researchers began to test the hypothesis that leukocyte chemotactic activity is a part of the wider activities exhibited by cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1). In 1987, we demonstrated, for the first time, the presence of a cytokine like chemoattractant with cell type-specificity (now known as the chemokine interleukin-8 or CXC chemokine ligand 8) that was different from IL-1. This led us to the purification of the second such molecule with monocyte chemotactic activity. This monocyte chemoattractant was found identical to the previously described LDCF or TDCF, and termed monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Isolation of MCP-1 created a revolution in not only inflammation but also cancer research that continues today, and MCP-1 has become a molecular target to treat patients with many diseases. In this review, I will first describe a history associated with the discovery of MCP-1 and then discuss complex mechanisms regulating MCP-1 production in tumor microenvironments.},

  abstract = {Brain-computer interface (BCI) provides direct communication between the brain and an external device. BCI systems have become a trendy field of research in recent years. These systems can be used in a variety of applications to help both disabled and healthy people. Concerning significant BCI progress, we may assume that these systems are not very far from real-world applications. This review has taken into account current trends in BCI research. In this survey, 100 most cited articles from the WOS database were selected over the last 4\,years. This survey is divided into several sectors. These sectors are Medicine, Communication and Control, Entertainment, and Other BCI applications. The application area, recording method, signal acquisition types, and countries of origin have been identified in each article. This survey provides an overview of the BCI articles published from 2016 to 2020 and their current trends and advances in different application areas.
