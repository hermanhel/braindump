This braindump is a direct follow up to [Jethro Kuan's braindump](https://braindump.jethro.dev/). Though I did it simpler, by just sync everything using _list-rsync_ to this repo and take his hugo theme.

I resolved the reference issue by using this github aciton which when uploaded to github repo would search all org files and replace org-id reference with file reference.(I haven't written it yet)
