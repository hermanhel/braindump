### Illustrate {#illustrate}

as from _ultralearning_


#### form {#form}

1.  Get a blank sheet of paper
2.  on top: the concept/problem to explain
3.  explain the idea as if teaching someone.
    -   concept:
        convey the concept to a people had never heard of it before
    -   problem:
        explain how to solve, and why the solution make sense

if stuck, meaning the understanding fails to give clear model of what's going on, and time to return to materials.


#### Applications {#applications}

<!--list-separator-->

-  1. for things don't understand at all

    compare my explaination to the book's

    -   find out difference
    -   reason the difference

<!--list-separator-->

-  2. for problems seem too hard to solve

    Solve the problem step by step alongside the explanation I generated.

-  3. for expanding the intuition (to other field/faster/stronger)

    Explain the idea in a more artful way. Make masterpieces. Make tutorials that people would bookmark and download to read.

    -   use `illustrative examples`, `analogies`, `visualizations`
    -   target people: people with far less knowledge than me. the minimal knowledge. the beginners.
