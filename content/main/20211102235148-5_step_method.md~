## Description {#description}

Formally addressed by _Ray Dalio_.
A progressive evolution machine to make anything better.


## Flow {#flow}


### 1. Set Goal {#1-dot-set-goal}


#### Outcome {#outcome}

-   Goal list (ordered)
    all in headings
    -   Goals
    -   Desires
    -   Assosaries
    -   Moderation


#### Procedure {#procedure}

<!--list-separator-->

-  1. Have a list of goals

    Use headings so wikilinks like[1. Set Goal](#1-dot-set-goal)s would be available

<!--list-separator-->

-  2. Check/Filter

    Sort out Desires and Assosaries

<!--list-separator-->

-  3. Order the goals/desires

    What is wanted the most? What's the best?

<!--list-separator-->

-  4. Ask: "How I'm gonna moderate my goals and desires?"

    Time spend? Money spend? Energy? schedule?


### 2. Find problem {#2-dot-find-problem}


#### Outcome {#outcome}

-   Problem list (ordered)
    -   Problem 1
    -   Problem 2


#### Procedure {#procedure}

<!--list-separator-->

-  1. have a list of problems

<!--list-separator-->

-  2. Check

    Miss of problems:

    -   Cause of problems?

    What kind it is:

    -   Skill?
    -   Weakness?

<!--list-separator-->

-  3. Order the problems

    Big problems and small problems


### 3. Analyse the problem to find the root of it {#3-dot-analyse-the-problem-to-find-the-root-of-it}


#### Outcome {#outcome}

-   Cause list
    -   Cause 1
    -   Cause 2


#### Procedure {#procedure}

<!--list-separator-->

-  1. Analyse each Problem

    have problem at on window, and cause list part on another window
    use wikilink to Link problems and causes

    Write direct cause in the problem list, and root cause in the cause list


### 4. Make solution to solve the problem. {#4-dot-make-solution-to-solve-the-problem-dot}


#### Outcome {#outcome}

-   Solution
    -   review
    -   future
    -   machine-modifications
    -   solution list
        -   SOLUTION solution 1
            -   TODO task 1


#### Procedure {#procedure}

<!--list-separator-->

-  1. Review

    What have been going through before the current state?
    What have been done?

    This part try to see the history and reality

<!--list-separator-->

-  2. Future

    What to do next to approach the goals?

    This part answer to the [1. Review](#1-dot-review) and the goals in Goal list

<!--list-separator-->

-  3. What to mend?

    Problems are results of the machines.
    What machines should be fixed? How to do that?

    This part answer to the Problem list

    Project proposed should be nested under goals or roles. Goals should be in roles.

<!--list-separator-->

-  4. Solutions `> =Tasks`

    There are machines for 1 type of tasks like reading, and machines for 1 project that is important like Winning my module credits. Each could have `bugs` like lost of key elements, or mismatch of flow, etc. Solution are established to fix those `bugs`

    Bugs:

    -   in Project machine
    -   in everyday machines

    **Solutions** (Make preparation to the presentations) should be direct on point of problem and whole, while **tasks** (write script) will be concrete and complement solution, make sure it will work

    This part answer to [2. Future](#2-dot-future) and [3. What to mend?](#3-dot-what-to-mend)

    solutions are denoted with tags on the solution list heading `:solution:`


### 5. Do anything necessary to practice the solution, and realize it. {#5-dot-do-anything-necessary-to-practice-the-solution-and-realize-it-dot}


#### Outcome {#outcome}


#### Procedure {#procedure}

When doing tasks

<!--list-separator-->

-  1. Tasks - Goals

    Ask the relations.
    get ref for it if don't remember

<!--list-separator-->

-  2. Make a standard of process for the task.

    This make sure that the solution are done strictly.


## Tasks {#tasks}


### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> A function to calculate Goal's time {#a-function-to-calculate-goal-s-time}

How many time I have spent in the goals?


## Aware of these things {#aware-of-these-things}


### Priorities in setting goals {#priorities-in-setting-goals}

Currently as default in org to be 3 levels.
See if it's too many or less.
