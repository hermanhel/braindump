## Categories {#categories}


### Purpose {#purpose}


#### Project machines {#project-machines}

A machine could be constructed just for a particular project, with itself used for only once.

Such machine have components that should work with each other that will make the project success, like my credit in EAP121 or make a particular robot.

components could be preparation of a presentation or moving algorithm of the robot


#### Everyday machines {#everyday-machines}

machines could also be designed to deal with a type of repetitive occuring tasks, like loundary.


### Shape {#shape}


#### Chain {#chain}

with steps and components and levels one after another to reach a higher height


#### Loop {#loop}

With repeating steps to accumulate and build height.


## Machine page {#machine-page}

machine page holdes all information of the machine, including implementation, scientific source, experiance reasons .etc.


### Implementation {#implementation}

When applying the machine in task/sessions, there could be some measures as below:


#### Information Scheme {#information-scheme}

There could be specific place to seek information needed for the machine.

Example:

-   slides-from lmo
-   mail list-collect through university websites

Currently, the informations are perfered to be collected in the scheme session, and wrote as detailed plan in the task descriptions.

Instead of that, a _Information Scheme_ could be established in the task description, with structure specified in the [Machine page](#machine-page) .
