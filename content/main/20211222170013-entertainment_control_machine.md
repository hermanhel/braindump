## Big Things {#big-things}


### <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2021-12-22 Wed&gt; </span></span> Serious Entertainment Move {#serious-entertainment-move}

From now on, A week, to <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2021-12-29 Wed&gt;</span></span>, no Traditional Entertainment. All replace to `Math`.

As Descrete Math is in the schedule, the math would be from `ACP`.

#### House M.D. {#house-m-dot-d-dot}

I love this show, both the case, story and House's personality.
