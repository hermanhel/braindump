## Method {#method}

I used the `build.py` and `ninja` approach and copyed `publish.el` most from
[Jethro's Braindump](https://github.com/jethrokuan/braindump/).
The build.py didn't work for me, so I borrowed from system crafter's org website tutorial the way to build: instead of a complete `init.el`, I used a minimal `init.el` to do the work.
