I want to be a Neuralscientist, to explore the mechanism of consciousness.
Hope that one day I could figure it out, and make something Really interesting.

In Order to be a great neuralscientist, I have to get into a major research center of neuralscience.
Therefore, I need academic success.
Hopefully I could go directly for my PhD, but that would require very good grade.
So, I set up the [Academic Machine]({{< relref "20211011005922-academic_machine.md" >}}).

It definitely need further research, but by now, my plan is


### 1. Very good grade in XJTLU {#1-dot-very-good-grade-in-xjtlu}
