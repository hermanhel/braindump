## Today's Plan {#today-s-plan}


### <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> Get to know the modules {#get-to-know-the-modules}


#### Goal {#goal}

To accomplish good grade in the modules.

Thus, the system of the module content should be examined, the system of university's deliver/teaching should be documented for further use, and a system of me with my own part and use of university's system to know about the module content system should be established.

<!--list-separator-->

-  requirement

    3 systems are to be established. Each will in form of a machine.

    -   Document Module Content System(MCS)
        name: (CPT102-MCS)
        Full of object/goals. Lack action/flow/principle
    -   Document University Teaching System(UTS)
        name: (CPT102-UTS)
        Will include schedule, resource, people to contact to.
        With defined APIs.
        Would imply some methods.
    -   Establish and Document Personal Acquisition System(PAS)
        name: (CPT102-PAS)
        Should include Princiople, Actions.
        Goal fits the goals in MCS.
        Use API from UTS wisely.

#### Log {#log}

I made decisions on what to do to make MCS,UTS,PAS settled.

Maybe I should reexamine these 3 systems in a while.

The ultimate result of the 3 systems should be data in data structures.

Reading irrelevent material(for current task). Should just skip for now

I first decided to spend 1 hour on each subject, but it seems to short. I spend 2 hour on 1 MCS. So I guess that's the real speed.

2 module each day. 2 hour for MCS, 0.5 hour for UTS.
