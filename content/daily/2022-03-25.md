## Atom habits <span class="tag"><span class="habit">habit</span></span> {#atom-habits}

Atom habits is a book with 4 laws which:

-   treat habit as atoms, that impact on each other to form moleculars
-   works as atoms that seperately influence the process of habit forming
-   tackle 4 atomic period of the process of doing a thing, to make it a habit, or make it not a habit.


### The 4 phases of the process in sight of habit. (continuous feedback loop) {#the-4-phases-of-the-process-in-sight-of-habit-dot--continuous-feedback-loop}


#### 1.cue {#1-dot-cue}

`phone buzz`


#### 2.craving {#2-dot-craving}

`"who messaged?"`


#### 3.response(take action to the crave) {#3-dot-response--take-action-to-the-crave}

`checking who messaged`


#### 4.reward {#4-dot-reward}

`sovled the probelm and happy.`


### The power of `atomic` habit {#the-power-of-atomic-habit}


#### 1. Massive action vs. 1% improvement {#1-dot-massive-action-vs-dot-1-improvement}

`the 1% improvement rules`
success is product of `daily progress`, and not `once-in-a-life action`


#### 2. truth of progress. {#2-dot-truth-of-progress-dot}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/progresstruth.png" >}}


#### 3. goals and systems {#3-dot-goals-and-systems}

Forget about the goals, focus on the `systems` instead

-   goals: the abstract outcome, result, like _get fit_
-   systems: the process that get you to the actual result

connecting with [5-step-analysis]({{< relref "../20220509205143-5_step_analysis.md" >}}) , where the goals are put forwarded first, but as a must followed by 4 other steps which refine the machine/system of accomplishing the goal.

> Goals -&gt; direction
> Systems -&gt; making progress


#### 4. atomic habits are the building block of remarkable result {#4-dot-atomic-habits-are-the-building-block-of-remarkable-result}


#### 5. 3 layers of bahaviour change {#5-dot-3-layers-of-bahaviour-change}

1.  outcome
    the result, the goal, the actual consequence
2.  process
    [Machine]({{< relref "../main/20211104155334-machine.md" >}})s
3.  identity
     role in [Roles]({{< relref "../main/20211008132927-roles.md" >}}).
    like [Athlete]({{< relref "../main/20211008134506-athlete.md" >}})


#### 6. habit loop {#6-dot-habit-loop}

habit is formed with repeated small session every day, each session formed with [continous feedback loop](#the-4-phases-of-the-process-in-sight-of-habit-dot--continuous-feedback-loop)

![](/ox-hugo/habitloop.png)
over time, `Chain` formed between `cue` and `reward`


### The 4 laws {#the-4-laws}


#### 1. Make it `obvious` {#1-dot-make-it-obvious}

<!--list-separator-->

-  1. Habit score card

    1.  list all behaviours
    2.  mark `+`, `-`, `=`, for positive, negative, and neutral

<!--list-separator-->

-  2. set Time and location

    `I will _behaviour_ at _time_ in _this location_.`
    I will read at 6 p.m on my desk.

    use a cue to trigger the habit. the cue should be something you do automatically without failing.

<!--list-separator-->

-  3. Habit stacking

    `After doing _current habit_, I will _new habit_.`
    after \_brushing my teeth, I'll strech for 5 minutes.

<!--list-separator-->

-  4. Environment vs. Motivation

    context is the cue.
    think: the house full with ~~object~~ `relations`
    I relax on my bed. I work on my desk
    one space, one use

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  1. make cue for good habit more easy to be seen

        place bottle in the house -&gt; drink more
        place book in the house -&gt; read more

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  2. make cue for bad habits invisible


#### 2. Make it `attractive` {#2-dot-make-it-attractive}

<!--list-separator-->

-  1. dopamine spikes

    -   Dopamine spikes in `craving`
        when a drug addicter `sees` drug.
    -   The `craving` causes us to `take action`
        the drug addicter `uses` drug after.

<!--list-separator-->

-  2. temptation bundling

    premack's principle: more prabable behaviors promote less prabable behaviors

<!--list-separator-->

-  3. group influence

    into a culture where the habit is norm

<!--list-separator-->

-  4. primitive `motives` -&gt; source of craving

    `the habits are modern-day solution to ancient desires`

<!--list-separator-->

-  5. reprogram the brain to accept hard habits

    Make the hard habits attractive by accosiating them with a positive experiance

    -   highlight the `benifit`
        fitness = `wellbeing` ~~fatigue~~

<!--list-separator-->

-  6. Make bad habit unattractive


#### 3. Make it easy {#3-dot-make-it-easy}

<!--list-separator-->

-  1. habit is framed in terms of number of repetitions

    ~~time~~

<!--list-separator-->

-  2. Reducing Friction: law of least effort

    read 1 page of book every day

<!--list-separator-->

-  3. Prime the environment for use

    Prepare the environment before.

<!--list-separator-->

-  4. use 2-minute rule to stop procrastinating

    just, 2-minute version of the habit.
    target: anchor the repetition
    consequence: sometimes the motivation of completion arrive after the start.

<!--list-separator-->

-  5. make bad habit impractical as possible


#### 4. Make it satisfying {#4-dot-make-it-satisfying}

<!--list-separator-->

-  1. The most important rule

    Satisfaction after the action promote `repetition`
    "This feels good, let's do it for another time"
    What is immediately rewarded is repeated, what is immediately punished, is avoided

<!--list-separator-->

-  2. Immediate/long-term award/punish

    adding little pleasure to long-run benefit, and pain to the long-run bad habit

<!--list-separator-->

-  3. Rewarding yourself and feeling succesful

    Use little wins, like a progress bar, a jar of marble, paper clip,

<!--list-separator-->

-  4. visual measurements

    logs, pagenumbers, journals...

<!--list-separator-->

-  5. Habit track

<!--list-separator-->

-  6. when bad days come......

    `Don't break the chain!`
    do the small version, just don't break the chain.

<!--list-separator-->

-  7. Habit contract.

    claims clear that you will honor a particular habit and that there will be punishments if you do not


### Method {#method}

1.  set target HABIT, and GOOD? to signify if it's a good habit.
2.  for each phase of habit loop, take corresponding action to push the habit to a direction of:
    -   obvious - invisible (for cue)
    -   attractive - unattractive (for craving)
    -   easy - hard (for responsing)
    -   satisfying/pleasure - unsatisfying/painful (for reward)
3.  Set mindset(background sound/principle/belief/viewpoint)
    -   like, when developing work out habit:
        -   thinking that 1% improvement rules
        -   thinking that showing up's half the bottle
        -   thinking that from the 3 layers, I identity myself as an athelete
        -   knowing that I'm probably in the valley of disappointment, so be patient.
            it's not a decision-result correspondency, but a viewpoint with respect of fact. It's a cognition, a thinking and evaluation with no interacting with the world, not changing the facts, no engineering, but by making evaluation of myself to certain realistic standards, I gain a cirtain emotion mode, which impact my feeling, action, motivation, crave, and reward(satisfacition.)

-  Cue - obvious

    -   Habit stack: I'll start coding, Right after I take my morning dump. I could use toilet time to think/deside what to do
    -   environment: I ahve ACP side of my desk.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Craving - attractive

    -   Reprogramming the brain
        -   the benefit of improving my coding skill:
            1.  I'll be more capable in engineering.
            2.  I'll be powerful
            3.  People would admire me
            4.  I'll have a lot of fun in programming and engineering a system
            5.  It'll enable me to eventually build my baby AI
            6.  The whole thing of coding/engineering would be more clear to me, instead of vague and frustrating mistery
    -   Temptation bundling
        After I've done a session of coding, I'll practice a knot

<!--list-separator-->

-  Response - easy

    -   least effort:
        I just have to code for 1 session to whatever material at hand.
        It could be from the _Hands-on intro to ML_ book, or a projectEuler challenge, or a random program from my todo list, anything would be suffice
    -   Prime the environment:
        Choose a coding task before I went to toilet, and open the file I needed.
    -   Use a 2-minuet version:
        Do 2-minute coding first if procrastinate. But I doubt if I will.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Reward - satisfying

    -   Adding little pleasure
        After the session, tie a knot.
        They are both engineering &amp; art
    -   Habit track
        Make a subtree coding in Engineering, style habit. Each day ofter the 1 session, set it marked.
    -   Habit contract
        In the heading, make declaims
    -   Visual measurements
        log every thing done. Round thing up

<!--list-separator-->
