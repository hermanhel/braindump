        "content": "Boyer-Moore String Search 算法是很快的字符串搜索算法\n想法 Boyer-Moore 算法的想法很简单:对齐后从后[P的末尾;S与P对齐位置的末尾]往前找mismatch, 在发生mismatch的时候,把整个pattern shift到可以match的一个位置.\n   S A B C A A B D     P    A B D    P     A B D         +     像上面这种情况, P[2]=D 和 S[5]=B 发生了 Mismatch, 就把P向右移动到P中右数第一个B和 S[5]=B 对齐,然后再重新开始从后往前搜索Mismatch.\n可以match的一个位置 这个知识显然来自P字符串.在Boyer-Moore算法中这个知识被储存在一个数组D中.D的长度是所有可能出现在 S 中的字符的数量,也就是说整个字符集中的每个字符都有一个对应的D的entry.\n这个知识的计算规则如下:\n 对于出现在P中的X,这个位置是最后一个X的位置[在P中] 对于未出现在P中的X,没有这个位置,将整个P移到mismatch发生位置的右边(即看作这个位置为-1).  大多数实现里这个位置的表示是P中最后一个X距离字符串末位的距离,如 “ABCD” 中,C对应的这个位置是用 1 来表示.不过 M-1 = 4-1 = 3 也没问题, 知识总量没变, 使用了另外的mapping, 要确认之后的mapping是对应的就OK.\n不过在 D 中不能出现 0 (距离) / M (位置), 因为 0费是危险的设计 存在0(或M)的 D 和之后的算法所张出的状态空间里会存在 “P一动不动” 的状态, 因为结束条件是P走完或者S走完,如果在P走不完,S在中间,P又一动不动,就会有无限的 斩杀 循环.\n结束条件  P走完 因为我们“走”过P和S对齐的位置的时候是在搜索mismatch, 所以P走完就是发现了一个Full match. 此时S中对齐的位置就是P的一个Full match的位置 S走完 同上,如果S走完都没发现Full match, 就是没有Full match.  Code # example of P and S S = \u0026#34;Herman is truely hot and handsome and wise and wit scholar.\u0026#34; P = \u0026#34;wise and wit\u0026#34; #end example #init the lengths N,M = len(S),len(P) #init D D = {}  def makeTable(P:str):  for i in range(0,M-1): #走一遍P,但是不走到P[M-1].[1] \tD[P[i]] = M - i - 1 #做 P[i] : M - i - 1 的Map. Key是P[i], Val是P[i]到末尾的距离. 注意到P[M-2] = 1. \t# 后面的occurance会覆盖前面的. 所以留下来的是最后的occurance def findLastOccurance(C:str):  # 套在字典D的外面,给D里没有的key提供一个default值, M(向右移一整个P那么多)  if not(D.get(C) is None): \treturn D.get(C)  else: \treturn M  def search(P:str,S:str):  #init  i,j,k = M,M,M #i:S上,P的尾巴对齐的位置(S[i-1]=P[M-1]). j:P上的comparison point. k:I上的comparison point.  while i \u0026lt; N and j \u0026gt; 0: # 结束条件: S走完(i\u0026gt;=N)或者P走完(j=0) \t#因为i、j、k都是从M开始,所以比较项的index都是i-1,j-1,k-1.如果是index从0开始的语言或者i,j,k从M-1开始,就是i,j,k,条件中的不等也要加入等于. \tif S[k-1] == P[j-1]: \t#发生Match时:往前走一格 \tj -= 1 \tk -= 1 \telse: \t#发生Mismatch:把P上离尾巴最近的一个P[x]=S[i-1]拽过来 [2]  \ti = i + findLastOccurance(S[i-1]) \tk = i \tj = M  if j == 0: \t#P走完了,有full match \treturn i #full match的右端位置  else: \t#P没走完,没有full match \treturn -1 makeTable(P) return search(P,S), S[search(P,S) - M:search(P,S)]  [1] 当P[M-1]上发生Match, 算法终止(full match); 当在S[i]=P[M-1]上发生Mismatch, 移动距离为0(无限循环+没什么用). [2] 这里是简化版的策略.完整的BM Search Bad Char Rule所寻找的是在 P[j-1] 前与 S[k-1] 相同的字符.这里,为了保证rightmost occurance所寻找的是在 S[x] 前的字符(即向右移动后能够对齐.如果所使用的P中的occurance在当前状态下在 S[k-1] 的左边,就得往左移动.), 将 x 设为 i-1 (对齐部分的最后一个字符).这种做法的效率可能低于精确的完整策略,但其正确性在后面得到了证明.  上面这段程序会给出 S 中的第一个 P 的full match右侧的index, 或者 -1, 如果 S 中没有 P 的full match.\n正确性 任何字符串搜索算法满足两个条件:\n 不漏 当前位置之前没有任何full match存在.(能搜好几次的算法是在搜到一次后在搜索算法外接了一个往后移一位重新开始搜索的机制) 已经匹配完成的部分是一个partial match 如果 P[0..4] 和 S[0..4] 已经匹配过,现在在比较 P[5] 和 S[5], 那么 P[0..4] 和 S[0..4] 满足 \\(\\forall k \\in [0,4]\\) , P[k] = S[k].  可以使用 partial match -\u0026gt; full match -\u0026gt; no full match 联系,写出以下三个相关联的predicates:\n partial match \\(P(i,j) = \\forall k : j\\le k \u0026lt; M:S_{i-M+k} = P_{k}\\) 从P的尾巴算起,到正在比较的P[j]和S[i-M+j],S和P的对应项都一样 full match \\(R(i)=P(i,0)\\) 从P的尾巴算起到头,S和P的对应项都一样 no full match \\(Q(i)=\\forall k: M \\le k \u0026lt; i : \\neg R(k)\\)  这样,我们算法的正确性就可以通过检查 \\(P(i,j)Q(i)\\) 来证明.\n初始化 P(i,M)和Q(M)都为真(因为上面取的不等)\nS[k-1]=P[j-1] Branch 假设在进入分支前P(i,j)Q(i)为真.\n Q(i) i 没有变, 所以Q(i)没有变 P(i,j) P(i,j)为真,即 \\(\\forall k : j\\le k \u0026lt; M:S_{i-M+k} = P_{k}\\) S[k-1]=P[j-1] =\u0026gt; 在改变k,j之前 P(i,j-1) 和 P(i,j)都为真, =\u0026gt; 在j = j-1后, P(i,j)为真.  else Branch 假设在进入分支前P(i,j)Q(i)为真.\n P(i,j) 在赋值后为P(i,M),为真 Q(i) 需要证明,Q(i+D[S[i-1]])在i更改之前成立.考虑到Q的定义和Q(i)为真,其等价为证明 \\(\\forall k: 1 \\le k \u0026lt; D[S[i-1]] - 1, \\neg R(i+k)\\)   根据表D制作的规则: 对一个字符 x \\(\\forall k: M - D\\le k \u0026lt; M - 1, P[k] \\ne x\\) 从尾巴数起,在这个距离以内都没有x\n  将 S[i-1] 代入 x: \\(\\forall k: M - D[S[i-1]] \\le k \u0026lt; M - 1, P[k] \\ne S[i-1]\\) 等价于 \\(\\forall h : 1 \\le h \u0026lt; D[S[i-1]], P[M-1-h] \\ne S[i-1]\\) 等价于 \\(\\forall h : 1 \\le h \\le D[S[i-1]], P[M-1-h] \\ne S[i-1]\\) 可推出 \\(\\forall h : 1 \\le h \\le D[S[i-1]], \\neg R(i+h)\\)\n简单来说,就是既然P[M-1]和S[i-1]mismatch,P中最近的一个S[i-1]又在P[D[S[i-1]]]的位置,到那里为止中间都没有S[i-1]这个字符,自然就没法有任何一个小于D[S[i-1]]的移动可以把P中的一个字符和S[i-1]对齐并发生Match,自然也就谈不上Full match了.\n对下面的情况, ABCB ABCD i = 4,在S[i-1]和P[M-1]发生了mismatch.  简单来说,就是既然P[M-1]:D 和S[i-1]:B mismatch,P中最近的一个B又在P[M - D[S[i-1]] - 1] = P[1] :B 的位置,到那里为止中间都没有S[i-1]:B 这个字符,自然就没法有任何一个小于D[S[i-1]] = 2的移动可以把P中的一个字符:{C,D}(小于二的移动可以和S[i-1]对齐的 P中字符的集合)和S[i-1]:B对齐并发生Match,自然也就谈不上Full match了.

You can drink whiskey and get drunk(or the default behaviour associate with drinking in your dictionary), or try to understand the taste, ingredients, interpreting the feeling to other form, do research or artistic activity\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;The difference is choice of paradigm[consumption/generation] rather than presence of product.\nthe same goes for consumption experience.\nyou can generate stuff in (or not in) generation paradigm. If you\u0026rsquo;re just generating stuff according to a standard/machine, it might be only 30% generation experience(less if you don\u0026rsquo;t undertand the machine very much, just following the instructions.). It\u0026rsquo;s still generation experience because the materials are from you\u0026rsquo;re memory/collection and understanding over them. But less.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not essentially bad. Generation typically cost more energy(then consuming), and is unstable(you might change the way you do one thing every time). So it\u0026rsquo;s generally considered economical to focus energy on generating critical parts (drawing, then how the picture would look like, the story in the illustration) and switch to consumption paradigm in others(how to draw shades, how to use brushes)\ncoming up with principles and using them is under generation and consuming paradigm, respectively.\ngeneration experience with happiness no significant drop observed.\nObserving an area with potentially less happiness at the beginning of a kind of the generation experience(when you lack skill and want to draw).

Like playing in a jazz band, you follow a made arrangement, and render/improvise on the sound. On creating that sound, you can use developed skill and/or explore new combination, form prototype of new skills to develop.\nreason to choose generation experienced over consumption  happiness rising you can expect stable and rising level of happiness(while that in consumption experience is droping). adjust old skill generation paradigm allows change. develop new skill generation paradigm allows change. need any creation/understanding generation paradigm allows change. consumption paradigm don\u0026rsquo;t allow change, only enhence, so no new understnading could be drew.

Principles general in this level I put them into the kernel machine\na list of examples  be proactive begin with end in mind first thing first  kernel machine in my day Time and space :\nThe first thing I wake up is initializing the kernel machine. And I generally do things according to it through out the day.\nWork :\nI bring forward other specific machines in my knowledge base/tool box following the suggestions in the kernel machine. Every time in a while I would check my status(focus, energy, thing at hand.etc) and review some principles.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s basically lots of triggers and some suggestions(look at agenda when idle), so it\u0026rsquo;s not a lot of work.\n[Fact-Concept-Procedure] It\u0026rsquo;s a decomposition of information entities I use a lot. The decomposition is effective under learning(acquisition) context and writing(generation) context, which are my most used contexts.\norganically attached to kernel machine When I\u0026rsquo;m rolling accross time in the kernel machine, I\u0026rsquo;ll encounter information. They would be labeld 1 of the 3 categories. I have lots of principles and predicates under both context on all 3 categories, so lots of educated action options would then emerge.\nprinciple and Machine It\u0026rsquo;s an paradigm to deal with circumstances with repeated encounters.\nprinciple I have seen 1 thing happen over and over again, and seen how they evolve. I could predict the consequence of cirtain decision(+action).\nUsing this knowledge, we could point the consequence to our goal, and make decisions that lead us to that concequence.\nmachine I deal with similar circumstance over and over again. I see the results of my decisions and actions. I could choose the ones that work best.\nI did a lot of principle-educated decision-making, and those proved good choice too goes into my toolbox.\nIt also serves as a context closure for principles.\nMy trials, experiances and ideas would add to my toolbox dealing the circumstance.\norganically attached to kernel machine Kernel machine itself is a machine: the circumstance it\u0026rsquo;s dealing with is me doing things (that\u0026rsquo;s why general principles goes there)\nAlso, kernel machine point me to other machines in some common daily circumstance (like feeling overwhelmed).\nRoles and RPG Who am I.\nRoles Role paradigm comes from Stephan Covey\u0026rsquo;s 7 habits of highly efficient people, in which it\u0026rsquo;s used to balance one man\u0026rsquo;s life in work, family, hobby, neighbourhood, .etc.\nIn my case, I have first thing first machine, using information of my Roles to make week plan.\nRPG RPG is the idea of using different mindset(set of principle) to add to the fun.\nFor me, I\u0026rsquo;d say to myself something like \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a hacker now, I do hacker stuff\u0026rdquo; and use some stylish principles in RPG/hacker to make myself feel more like a hacker.\nwith kernel machine kernel machine works around a schedule. Roles information are used to make that schedule.\nThere are lots of gaps in kernel machine, and very roughly defined(abstract) behaviours. RPG have some stylish principles that could implement some of kernel machine(and other machine)\u0026rsquo;s blank. And it feels funny.\nexperiment Any knowledge I could only trust if it\u0026rsquo;s backed with reality.\nChecking heresay principles Lots of people share their experiances and advices (sometimes systems) on Internet/seminar/reports. They often come in suggestions or principle, like \u0026ldquo;do that\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t do that\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;think that way\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t think that way\u0026rdquo;.\nSome of them seems make sense and some don\u0026rsquo;t. But neither could you trust before you test them on yourself. Does this principle work for you? Only practicing it can tell.\nwith kernel machine There\u0026rsquo;s no link drawn yet. There is a trigger for circumstances where \u0026ldquo;I have doubts or hypothesis around a principle/machine\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s currently under experiment machine though.\nConsidering experiment the mechanism to adjust every principle/mahcine, kernel machine is under its supervision too.\nDescription of above Next is an overview of Herman the Machine.\nIn the machine Herman the Machine, I started kernel machine when I\u0026rsquo;m wake, recognizing things as fact-concept-procedure, and do things according to principle/machine. I walk* as said above, and I walk to the direction of my roles, dressing in my RPG. I grow as I walk, and intake only truth after it being experimented.\n*: \u0026ldquo;walk\u0026rdquo; is anology of \u0026ldquo;doing things and make progress on some thread/standard/storyline\u0026rdquo;\n",

(所以经常看到课堂里面老师在黑板上面指来指去w)\n当然, 这些大脑自动完成的部分也很受精力、大脑满满当当的程度这些即时变量的影响, 所以发现自己有当机或者看着符号一点想法都没有, 休息和以放空为目的的冥想也是好选择.\n在这种paradigm的指导下, 就有一种基于exposure多于hard work的行动原则. 在看一本书的时候选择很平滑的扫过去, 很casual, 有觉得有意思的就可能多想想, 写写笔记什么的, 没有也不经过「精读」死盯一会儿乃至于脑子里面对此处进行关键词检索段阶段, 就溜过去. 这样看会觉得这种会不会太轻松会不会漏掉很多, 不过这种办法基本上都会扫蛮多遍, 毕竟扫一遍也不太花时间, 记笔记那精读的也要记笔记, 记笔记的时间都一样. 像东尼博赞有本书里介绍他的「博赞学习技巧」, 里面有一个阶段叫「总览」, 基本上就是这种很平滑地扫, 提到了一个案例就是一个学生在一个月里把一本研究生的数学书(可能像《数学分析》这样的?)扫了二三十遍. 像我这样不太聪明的人可以用一个上午才看完一个写了三页的算法, 一个月按精读可能一遍也看不完w 还有就是像Anki这样的闪卡, 看正面一眼想不到背面基本就不会太卡在上面, 看看背面想想关联就换一张了. 在行事上面 ,就是像把一幅画画很多遍, 每次都不太深抠哪里的细节, 哪里想画画哪里, 基本上靠当时画面给的启发多过提前的计划.\n我也见到过一些说什么「用力想想会让答案更记忆深刻」的书, 好像是在说active recall的时候, 说在想不起来的时候active recall也是有用的, 会让千呼万唤始出来的答案尤其记忆深刻, 但我想那种「用力想想」应该也是说问很多不同的问题, 像「这块肌肉是连接手臂和胸骨的,所以它名字里应该有它们两个\u0026hellip;?」「好像连接方式是倒过来的,名字里面有提到吗?」「它上面那块肌肉叫xxx,名字是不是差不多?」「好像下面有一块肌肉连接方式差不多,名字是不是一个模式?」这样, 原则和信息都流很大, 到时候答案一出来这些问题都有回答, 一下子就很多和已经记住的东西的联系. 这些联系又都是受力的(连到之前没太联系到的信息),所以高效.\nStop point 在什么时候我认为我已经「够了解了」, 可以暂时停下调查? 我认为是可以解释清楚, 画出图像, 举出好几个例子 的时候. 无论是了解政策、算法、还是物理概念, 都可以使用这一个停止的benchmark. 同时, 也要注意这个benchmark的context是「一种情况」. 我需要能够做到的是「快速举出一种情况的好几个例子」. 如果我认为我需要掌握一个物理公式 如F=ma 那么我需要对每一个组成部分做相似的study, 对每一个元素适用这个benchmark, 如a的情况: 线性上升, 线性下降, 不变, 遵循函数\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\n另一个例子是对于音乐中的概念, 也是在当我可以解释清楚, 画出图像, 举出好几个例子的时候可以move on. 像Funk base line, 要在我能够解释清楚一些制作的原则, 画一些示意图, 能够快速举出几个制作、演奏和成品base line的例子的时候可以move on.\n写长一点 好像写得长一点, 说话就变得中性了. “按照他的逻辑,世界上所有的人都欠他的”, 和“从他的陈述中所构建出来的这一种人与社会的模型中, 可以发现一种明显且范围广大的不对等现象, 以每一个个体为中心, 向周围的社会部分倾斜.” 相比, 否定的倾向就很明显了, 好像隐隐加了一句“但是他是错的” 在句子后面. 但是从两个句子里不太能发现有什么用词的区别, 只有一个“欠”字, 好像带一些情感. 前一种好像急着说完, 好不再讨论这个话题, 而第二种比较耐心, 好像更加深入地希望了解“他的逻辑” 的细节, 制造出一种“好像这玩意儿能有点用”的气氛, 也许也传递了冷静下来分析了解的学者的context. 不过, 这两句话一短一长, 说的内容是差不多, 甚至短的版本还表达了自己的观点, 说得更多一点, 也许也是「少就是多」的一种表现.\nNo go An action of saying no go to a desire (like go to toilet with phone), and not doing it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an practice to the skill of rejecting desires facilitated with no go 突触.\nA script of this action is:\n I do this 25 times a day I record on the no go entry on habitica every time.

Yet some really unsatisfying conditions should be avoid.\ncopy large text from source sin:\n generally, a note should be that long. Node like Linear Algebra is a exception. Inside it are small, self-containing nodes, which could standalone very well. Them stacking together save my screen space (they tend to appear together) I don\u0026rsquo;t remember copied large text very well. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember it\u0026rsquo;s meaning, and then have to re-read it again. It might not use a lot of time, but it\u0026rsquo;s very annoying finding things you don\u0026rsquo;t have control over ion your note. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember it\u0026rsquo;s purpose, and it\u0026rsquo;ll be a very dirty nonsence in my note.  outline from index Well, Generally it\u0026rsquo;s considered a well-organized approach to first have a outline exactly like the index, and plan your time according to it.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how I find it not working:\n  You start copy 1 thing, you start copy another, and you should not copy large text from source. Once you accept the materials largest outline, you might have to accept it\u0026rsquo;s in-chapter outline, and then the paragraph\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nOne thing after another, you\u0026rsquo;ll be forced to copy large texts from source, without further processing, and found you lost your foundation for understanding further content in a garden fall of familiar flowers without names.\n  The writer\u0026rsquo;s organization might not work for you, especially in the first pass. when lack experiance with a field, one can\u0026rsquo;t really understand what\u0026rsquo;s behind the name of the chapters. Some are intuitive, some are strange, some are conflict. Forcing yourself to understand what the writer think is sometimes misleading. It\u0026rsquo;s better to consider the truths themselves.\n  and here\u0026rsquo;s my suggestions for using outlines:\n [checklist] Use it as checklist item, as you still need to start/end somewhere, and have progress track. [atom] break the outline into the smallest pieces, and rearrange them to your liking. [evaluating] treat it as a work of classmate and not holy rules, evaluate where of it looks good and where is strange.  Try to understand the author/lecturer rather than the knowledge when note from a book/lecture, we are tricked into repeating the words from the lecturer.\nAll description provides dimensions and point of view. Not necessarily accurate or consistant. ref/jargon issue.\nDirectly go for the knowledge is better. The objective is understand no one but knowledge.\nVery long, detailed note, providing too much justification rather than observation Like in this page. I gotta rearrange it someday.\nBad for  Difficult to read. usually not justified well, making the observations not reliable hiding useful information little use justification in some notes. too trival.  Not reviewing/rearranging the notes a big problem of mine is that I don\u0026rsquo;t do a thing twice.\nGenerally, I think of doing a thing as 1 time in the future 30. It\u0026rsquo;s logical that I don\u0026rsquo;t do things perfectly in the first run. But the ugly outcome often prevent me from reviewing or manipulating it again\nsource and attribution This machine borrowed vastly from Jethro Kuan\u0026rsquo;s way of note-taking.
