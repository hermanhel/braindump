I shall make a lot of errors, and each will gave me insight, and never happen again.</p><p>Learning is not reading book once, and feeling good. That&rsquo;s another behaviour of my feeling-good instinct, the shortcut is takeng in order to feel good instead of becoming stronger. As my errors have taught me: <code>Reading book once and feeling good have low efficiency in learning.</code></p><p>The path is proven to be false by experiance. Reading a book over and over again, would that be a good answer? As my experiance with the <em>Mindmap</em> (Tony Bozan&rsquo;s series) tells: <code>Reading a book over and over again along does no good</code></p><p>Then, is there any experiance of mine telling a working strategy for my learning with <strong>other&rsquo;s experiance</strong>?</p><p>As my experiance with Piano & literature taught me:</p><ul><li><p><code>mimicing great artworks works</code>
my piano/music skill builds totally on experiancing, practice, mimicing others work. All those elements are retrived from my years of memory of listening, playing the classic piano works</p></li><li><p><code>practice and self connecting works</code>
I figured the webber&rsquo;s rule of motivation very early, and use that as a base theory every since. That along beyond other theories I read about but not using sticks and have more meaning to me.</p><p>However, I think, <strong>practice or self connecting</strong> along won&rsquo;t work. With art, they happens simultaneously, I write things out, I play a tone, the connecting holds in form of idea. sometimes out of instinct, because I know the field very well. However, if I&rsquo;m just playing a note without no rhythm at all, or repeatedly writing &ldquo;the article, the article, the article&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;ll help.</p><p>this lead to a refined version of this principle:
<code>practice and self connecting *with principle* works</code></p><p>Now, since <code>principle</code> have caused me a lot of trouble, I think it&rsquo;s appropriate to clarify what it is and how it will and won&rsquo;t work.</p><ul><li><p>What it is:
<code>principle</code> is abstraction of experiance. It&rsquo;s <code>rule</code>.</p><p>experiance, once finished, should have a result (this is a principle too, to finish the experiance, and to have result, and the fact the experiance, once finished, should have result).
Then, there will be this one-to-one relationship with the decisions made during the experiance and the result. These corelations are <code>facts</code>, <code>experiance</code> some may call it.
To be clear, I&rsquo;ll refer <code>experiance</code> to the big, event-unit whole of memories, and <code>facts</code> to the small decision-result corelations.</p><p>Therefore, from <code>experiance</code>, we derive <code>facts</code>. <code>facts</code> are like points(x,y), with x the decision, y the result.
Among all <code>facts</code>, pattern could be recognized. But a <strong>pitfall</strong> could be that whether the facts are enough. I didn&rsquo;t do any summary work on my <code>facts</code>.</p><p>Meanwhile, I also have certain <code>goals</code>. they are my wish and intent, my imagination of future and ideal. They could be categorized into <code>of performance</code>, which most of them will be, and <code>of choice</code> which would be a handful, but also critical.
an example of <code>goal of performance</code> is academic credit. Generally, boost in academic credit have no effects but good in any field. It&rsquo;s like a black box in functional programming, we want the function just to be faster and using less space, and once it does, it can be just good. In these units of life, the <code>goal</code> is just to increase my <code>performance</code> .</p><p>an example of <code>goal of choice</code> is neuroscience participation. This field I like only out of interest. In my whole university period, I could be participating Business fields, Stock competition, Business competition, Financial Lab, they are generally good, generally <code>goal of performance</code>, they couldn&rsquo;t harm, but are with no contribution to my neuroscience participation, my <code>goal of choice</code>. Nothing should be done unless it&rsquo;s sub to at least one <code>goal of choice</code> of mine, that&rsquo;s how important they are.(this is a <code>principle</code> itself!)</p><p>every <code>goal of performance</code> should be subject at least on <code>goal of choice</code> of mine.</p><p><code>goal</code> + <code>fact</code> = <code>principle</code>
<code>goals</code> almost always come with <code>requirements</code>, the credit requires exam and practical skill and large-enough knowledge bank, the neuroscience requires field knowledge, appropriate skill-set and social relation network, all could be written in form of <code>results</code>, which are subject to, or should be the inevitable consequence of some <code>decisions</code>, according to the <code>fact</code>.(pitfalls to avoid to, like suspended)</p><p>Then, what to do is pretty obvious. <code>Do the thing that ensure credit</code> and <code>avoid things that lose credit</code> would be the lead principles with the <code>goal</code> credit.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-clojure data-lang=clojure>(<span style=color:#66d9ef>defmacro </span>with-principle-do
