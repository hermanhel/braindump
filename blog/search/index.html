It could be a double-edged sword. I\u0026rsquo;m really fascinated by the idea of performing a strategy, like that in LOL, other games, reading novels(click to next page), masturbating\u0026ndash;all the stuff that I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what will be the result, but I have a image of it, whether it\u0026rsquo;s totally imaginary or empirical. The idea of having a prediction of future, and act to realize it caught me.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s also source of my interest of learning how to write every sound and paragraph I see. I want to be able to make everything I senced. That\u0026rsquo;s what I say when I refer to Artist and Engineer.\nThis relationship is worth examine and use.\nalso, it contributes to my resistence to things I\u0026rsquo;m not familiar with, with no paradigm or principle to follow.\nAlways doing entertaining things rather than hard things DOn\u0026rsquo;t read mail and posts due to laziness Casually have no energy to do anything\nLittle care of what\u0026rsquo;s being done \u0026amp; Genius worship I have little care of my work and deeds, the things I figured out.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the cause of myself not reviewing or practicing anything or acting with my principles.\nSuch might trace back to my Genius worship.\nI think that all things happened to me will stick forever, because I\u0026rsquo;m a genius. Same worship to muscle memory also exist, that I should practice something to muscle memory and it sticks forever.\nTruth is the odd of it happening second time is the odd they have happened before: 1 time in 18 years, or 10 times in a week. This is a usage of the tradition.\nMeanwhile, such worship also stands for my almightiness, that I could finish everything within a tap.\nTruth is that I could do anything but not everything. Time is never enough, and is critical.\nToo much concern on the way others see me\u0026ndash;Low self-esteem low self-esteem seem to be a major cause. I don\u0026rsquo;t want others look down on me, don\u0026rsquo;t want them think me as a lazy, stupid, unprofesstional, ignorant, foolish kid, though I really am one.\nI fear the true nature of myself, while worshiping beatiful characteristics, like 007\u0026rsquo;s professional skills and style, like being on principles. I convince myself that these natures are all inside me in the distance of one call.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s true that they are one call far. But if I don\u0026rsquo;t call, they won\u0026rsquo;t be present, due to the distance, and the reality of my true nature. I know the strategy and the image, but not the reality. I hate this reality, so I\u0026rsquo;m not looking it.\nI should not be caring of others opinions about me. These are going to change anyway, my goals, on the other hand, would stick. I now know the strategy. I\u0026rsquo;m dying to see the image.\nfear to communicate with others(teacher or fellow student) when left behind\nFocus too nervous Could be due to Too much concern on the way others see me\u0026ndash;Low self-esteem. I\u0026rsquo;m easy to get nervous instead of excited and relax.\nThe examples is the tension on my forehead. Such tension will come up when ever I want to focus, especially when reading not familiar texts like English or Math, or Academic things.\nI\u0026rsquo;m forced to raise my forhead tension, reading out, getting nervous on not familiar things. New songs could be another example. I could do much more dynamic and steady flow on an old song of mine but only squeezed scream on new songs.\nGotta be relaxed. especially for focus.\nFocus easy to parish Improvising everything while the passion would parish easily\nImcapablity to give up I can\u0026rsquo;t give up anything.\nThings become valuable when I reexamine them and throw out some.\nSolution Review   Good things\n I have immplemented Emacs along with org-mode and org-roam for my note-taking I have being using principles and machines as main percpectives of my life and planning I have decided my Goals.

I shall make a lot of errors, and each will gave me insight, and never happen again.\nLearning is not reading book once, and feeling good. That\u0026rsquo;s another behaviour of my feeling-good instinct, the shortcut is takeng in order to feel good instead of becoming stronger. As my errors have taught me: Reading book once and feeling good have low efficiency in learning.\nThe path is proven to be false by experiance. Reading a book over and over again, would that be a good answer? As my experiance with the Mindmap (Tony Bozan\u0026rsquo;s series) tells: Reading a book over and over again along does no good\nThen, is there any experiance of mine telling a working strategy for my learning with other\u0026rsquo;s experiance?\nAs my experiance with Piano \u0026amp; literature taught me:\n  mimicing great artworks works my piano/music skill builds totally on experiancing, practice, mimicing others work. All those elements are retrived from my years of memory of listening, playing the classic piano works\n  practice and self connecting works I figured the webber\u0026rsquo;s rule of motivation very early, and use that as a base theory every since. That along beyond other theories I read about but not using sticks and have more meaning to me.\nHowever, I think, practice or self connecting along won\u0026rsquo;t work. With art, they happens simultaneously, I write things out, I play a tone, the connecting holds in form of idea. sometimes out of instinct, because I know the field very well. However, if I\u0026rsquo;m just playing a note without no rhythm at all, or repeatedly writing \u0026ldquo;the article, the article, the article\u0026rdquo;, I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;ll help.\nthis lead to a refined version of this principle: practice and self connecting *with principle* works\nNow, since principle have caused me a lot of trouble, I think it\u0026rsquo;s appropriate to clarify what it is and how it will and won\u0026rsquo;t work.\n  What it is: principle is abstraction of experiance. It\u0026rsquo;s rule.\nexperiance, once finished, should have a result (this is a principle too, to finish the experiance, and to have result, and the fact the experiance, once finished, should have result). Then, there will be this one-to-one relationship with the decisions made during the experiance and the result. These corelations are facts, experiance some may call it. To be clear, I\u0026rsquo;ll refer experiance to the big, event-unit whole of memories, and facts to the small decision-result corelations.\nTherefore, from experiance, we derive facts. facts are like points(x,y), with x the decision, y the result. Among all facts, pattern could be recognized. But a pitfall could be that whether the facts are enough. I didn\u0026rsquo;t do any summary work on my facts.\nMeanwhile, I also have certain goals. they are my wish and intent, my imagination of future and ideal. They could be categorized into of performance, which most of them will be, and of choice which would be a handful, but also critical. an example of goal of performance is academic credit. Generally, boost in academic credit have no effects but good in any field. It\u0026rsquo;s like a black box in functional programming, we want the function just to be faster and using less space, and once it does, it can be just good. In these units of life, the goal is just to increase my performance .\nan example of goal of choice is neuroscience participation. This field I like only out of interest. In my whole university period, I could be participating Business fields, Stock competition, Business competition, Financial Lab, they are generally good, generally goal of performance, they couldn\u0026rsquo;t harm, but are with no contribution to my neuroscience participation, my goal of choice. Nothing should be done unless it\u0026rsquo;s sub to at least one goal of choice of mine, that\u0026rsquo;s how important they are.(this is a principle itself!)\nevery goal of performance should be subject at least on goal of choice of mine.\ngoal + fact = principle goals almost always come with requirements, the credit requires exam and practical skill and large-enough knowledge bank, the neuroscience requires field knowledge, appropriate skill-set and social relation network, all could be written in form of results, which are subject to, or should be the inevitable consequence of some decisions, according to the fact.(pitfalls to avoid to, like suspended)\nThen, what to do is pretty obvious. Do the thing that ensure credit and avoid things that lose credit would be the lead principles with the goal credit.\n(defmacro with-principle-do [[goals facts] \u0026amp; doings];; goals(goal [requirements]) facts(decision [consequences]) doings(lists with decisions (decision args)) `(do ... ;; for every doing, find a coresponding facts with similar decision. ;;with that decision, test if any mapped consequence fit or contrast any requirement in goals. ;;if fit, do. if not fit or contradict any requirement, hold for examination )) (defmacro find-act-with-principle [[goals facts]] ;; for every requirement in goals, search facts for similar consequences and return the corresponding decision ) ;; to put the code into real use, still need: ;; + data representation of the above things. ;; + sementic parser for natural language and the data representation ;; + a approximate \u0026#34;equals\u0026#34; function that could tell similarity in requirements and ;; consequences from above could could tell that principle is a conjoint way of saying \u0026ldquo;corresponding the soncequences of facts known and the requirements of the goals\u0026rdquo;. with-principle is just exactly that meaning.\nMy experiance from past with principles tells me that a randomly-stated principle with no test, experiment(formal test) or backing fact, only very abstract vagaue meaning don't work at all. they could even blind your eye for the really important few.\nHowever, sometimes the there could be stated principles, having their own description, not just a abstraction of a relationship.\n examples are:  from Principle by Ray Daleo   做一个超级现实的人.\n  真相(对现实的准确理解)是任何良好结果的根本依据.\n  不要担心其他人的看法,不要让别人的看法成为你的障碍.\n  头脑极度开放、极度透明对于快速学习和有效改变来说是价值无限的.\n     This is because Most times, we don\u0026rsquo;t have clear memory on every experiance, or don\u0026rsquo;t recall them directly. Sometimes, we don\u0026rsquo;t have personal failure/success on some topic. In both cases, patterns are recognized and formulated into clever sentences introducing the pattern, to remember or to share They are written in simple sentences. Mostly, they are field specific in topic and context, you can sence it through the words. However, pitfalls could be that these sentences are to easy to say. to easy to have wrong meaning, or no meaning at all. One should always treat stated principle with very high awareness and alert. Like they\u0026rsquo;re mind controlling vampires and all you have against them are:  clear image of how the principle apply to reality clear definition of your goals of choice   rules are that a stated principle:  should never be spoken lightly must after research, or at least testing personally. should be logictically reasoned sometimes couldn\u0026rsquo;t, but at least try. should never be taken lightly must after research, or at least testing personally. should take 1 by 1. Multiple intake always result in ignorance and compound influence distracting you from the real good/bad ones.        sumary about the principle Formation from errors and experiances comes facts. Facts contains decision and result from personal belief and reality comes goals, of choice or of performance. goals contains specific goal and requirement an act with principle make decisions on what strategy/thing to do base on reality, look to goals. That is, in combination of requirement and result, referencing the decisions\nWhen patterns are recognized and reasoned, stated principle may be addressed. They, however, could be dangerous while helpful, so must be treated with care, including double check on their reality image, goal hierachy or reason. Don\u0026rsquo;t let them mislead you to a god-knows-where direction.\nACTIVE Recovery to Principles agenda I decided to recover to life with machines and principles.

Threading准备了一个易于重载的 思维环境 可以在每次回到Thread Task时快速进入Thread的Mindset 在这方面Thread类似机器和Project. Project也许可以看作一种特殊的Thread. 或者说,把Thread看作成一种对于线性结构的Interface, Project则是与内容相关,是为了一个目标而组成的机器.    Thread与Project的不同在于Project是为了特殊目标在的.而Thread是完全为了实施的目的. 当我看到Thread的时候,我就基本知道今天要做什么了.推进这些Thread是工作的内容.开始Thread,执行,然后对Thread进行总结.Thread由一个一个的session组成.每个Project可能都会管理几个Thread,也可能有些Thread没有project,但是就像桌子上没有名字的笔记纸一样需要被进行和完成,我们可以看见它之后也许有的发展, 可预见地,Thread list会成为一个比较庞大的列表,或许有点杂乱.每个Thread都应该有一个关于时间的建议,关于下一个session应该定在什么时候,比如有些有deadline的,就应该在deadline之前把所有过完.\n另一个问题是Thread应该作为THREAD-TODO-NEXT-DONE这样的形式,是任务分类的一个类别,还是作为Day Scheduling的一个部分,也就是当前正在进行的Thread.一个中间的方案是像NEXT一样,只激活当前正在进行的thread,另一个是像ACTIVE project 一样,对THREAD打tag,只显示带有agenda的.这种情况下,agenda标签作为激活与否的标志,而thread作为任务的分类.考虑到tag带有遗传特性,Thread作为组合单位不适合当tag,而 :agenda: 作为激活的标志,被Thread中的Task继承是合理的.\n所以,在Project下,以Action组织采取的行动和方法,以Thread组织任务session的实施.因为Active project是打了:agenda:标签的,相应的Thread也会继承 :agenda: 标签.\nThreading的条件是持久,accumulative.\nThread 不一定是提前完全写好的一系列task DONE 1, DONE 2, TODO 3,也可以是一个很可以继续发展下去的主题,比如Machine Learning DONE 4 Kaggle tutorial 3, 下一个可以是Kaggle tutorial 4, 或者Clojure with Machine Learning Chaptor 4之类的. 而关于Recourse的Thread,即同时看两本书,是否给每一本书一个Thread,我觉得在这些session并不那么distinct的时候是不必要的.但这些可以写在Thread的Scheduling Recommandation里.\nNote-\u0026gt;Writeing Model 小泉八云的写作机器:\n 记录最得意的部分 放置一天 防止厌倦 写点周边相关的笔记 写一遍 再写一遍 再写一遍  前面几乎都只是在记录相关的笔记而已,然而在这个过程中,其中的关系就更明晰了,文思结构就更完整,更适宜了.\ninterface 是我们平时思考的自然. 一个东西自然拥有多个方面可以看待.而我们思考事物时也是一样:我今天做的事情,有计划、有学习\u0026hellip;然而都可以看作写作.所以小泉八云的写作模式可以拿来用.\n",url:"https://hermanhel.github.io/braindump/daily/2022-02-24/"},"https:\/\/hermanhel.github.io\/braindump\/daily\/2022-03-01\/":{title:"2022-03-01",tags:["draft","draft"],content:"做了什么? 我不知道我做了什么.学到了怎么做一件事,如何确定,如何得知有一件事被做下了?\n准确来说,如何知道「我学到了一个知识」这个目标或者行为,得到了达成?\n考试是一个方面.于此相同的,quiz,Active Recall.\n另一方面,实用的知识可以用以建造和工程.在这一方面,对于所学技巧/原则/知识的应用可以体现在实施的工程,比如写一个函数、曲子,建造一个结构.\n在这些之上,知识在头脑里的储存,是联想、多维度的.能够将其转化为一维的语言,也可以看作是能够活学活用的体现.所以写Tutorial,解释文章,博客,或者Essay是好的「做了什么」的衡量.\n复习一下9个学习策略  Metalearning Focus Direct Drill Active Recall/retrival [] Feedback [] Retention [] Intuition Experiment  做了什么事之后,可以确定是学习了呢? 我上了一节课,我在什么时候学习了呢?\n学习了能够用来做东西的原则,那么就拿它来做东西. 学习了好像不太能直接拿来做东西的知识,就用它写essay. 可以写很多次同一个范围的essay.就像小泉八云写东西的方法一样.\n其中可以一直使用Active Recall. 做事情的过程就是学习,这样是direct.每一次带入新的原则,每一次总结新的点,得到新的知识和knowledge of dependency.\n",url:"https://hermanhel.github.io/braindump/daily/2022-03-01/"},"https:\/\/hermanhel.github.io\/braindump\/daily\/2022-03-03\/":{title:"2022-03-03",tags:["draft","draft"],content:"What am I doing?

What am I considering right now? The Environment, the notes and machines I put just there on my desk, thinking that I could really get a great use of that?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s Brain dump! That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m constantly thinking about, in the back of my brain. I thought about whether it should be in form a a handwritten literature or being produced using automatic programs, just like org-mode. I personally prefer the muanual approach, maybe because I like writing, and not familiar with the program, but familiar to writing, and the layout of the ideas in my mind, and always forgetting where I put the components of the machine, the program, and how the work. These things, they are not like the prooven fact, but some arbitery ramdom choices. The random choices have their power, they are systematic, and therefore, it\u0026rsquo;s something you could do, without hisitation. It\u0026rsquo;s somewhere to go back to when there\u0026rsquo;s no better ideas. However, they could be not working, as well. Like I have written a \u0026ldquo;so-called\u0026rdquo; optimization of a algorithm, but it don\u0026rsquo;t work very well on very much cases, being a proof of not everything systematic work\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s ture, some system could have no sence at all. And that\u0026rsquo;s the dead end, I usually encounter.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m trying to do, is essentially, a expansion of myself. And the expansion, in some ways, is not just wanting to grow in essential strength, like the ability to understand, the ability to memorizem, the ability to connect things, to calculate, to laern, to sing, to kept my hand steady for what ever I want, to control my body and mind, to schedule my thinking and doing, but a expansion of a desicion system. I always thought of this systeeem like emacs, but with more autonomouus, that it is a set of working machine, and continue to generate new machines as its expansion, making it grow.\nEssentially, all the things I deal with are decision making. In terms of business, it\u0026rsquo;s all decision making, but in terms of other fields, like in computer science, it got complicated, involving skills. Now what are skills? I don\u0026rsquo;t know, to frankly speaking. Skill set? I know the corelating chineses word, and I stopped there for future thinking. It\u0026rsquo;s just like declare in clojure, the concept is declare, I heard of it, even familiar with it, but don\u0026rsquo;t know it\u0026rsquo;s meaning, don\u0026rsquo;t know how, in what form it exist. I even don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s a real thing, I just heard of it very often, and I assume it that way. These declared things made up a great part of my life, due to my preference of high-level shi. I feel superior with high level thinking brah brah brah, I like it so much that I don\u0026rsquo;t even care if these theory I am speaking of really exist, really consistent with the reality. I needed the theoroies to prove my class. It\u0026rsquo;s the valarie that drives me to these theories that don\u0026rsquo;t work, that are absolutely trival nonsence, that are not interesting at all. It\u0026rsquo;s this ego that blind my eyes. And it\u0026rsquo;ll carry on this blindness for a very long while, though I could state that I have a much better situation than when I was like 3rd-grade. Ego blind me from Reality, just like Ray said.\nFrom what I observed, skills are really like machines, which I know is about what. I know that a machine is a set of steps and desicion rules that are engineered to have a result happen. It\u0026rsquo;s a natural science, taking facts as it\u0026rsquo;s material, and use calculation, to have this result, in no time. The time the decision make and action done, the result is definite. Learning a skill set, is like confirm a set of machines. These machines are the steps to do a thing, like the skill to write essay correspond to Essay-writing machine, and the skill to play basketball/throw a ball into basket have the corresponding steps and principles. When talking of skills, we are think of ways of doing things, like how to throw a ball, it would involve angle of arm, point of force, and even subtle movement of finger. And when we can naturally do them, as if we are born hard-coded to do so, we say that I have mastered the skill. When I can throw a ball from any where into the basket without thinking, I have mastered the throwing. And that reveals the 2 seemed contrary description of skill:\n  Systematic When talking about a skill, we almost always talk about what to do, and the process is usually fixed, I throw the ball like that in every field. There\u0026rsquo;s principle, like thinking the ball to be pushed against the elbow, followed by theories to support and prove that this process/principle is valid and working, sometimes the best, sometimes efficient. We could write a book about a skill. We can say that skills are built from the basic building blocks that we can do withouot thinking. and sometimes, it\u0026rsquo;s categorized against literature/art/phylosophy. Or plain facts, them employing skills to find. them all facts and no what to do about it.\n  Natural However, the mastering of a skill is usually judged by how fast people make the decisions of action to take next, and how accurate, even in fields that are not as time-intensive like basketball. It\u0026rsquo;s not a man can do a job with strict reference to a guideline, that he could be considered a skilled worker, but he could do the job, even without thinking about what should be done. The memory, should be so natural, that like they are not arbitery defined human process, which is infinite many, but plain facts of the world. Throwing a ball. It\u0026rsquo;s just easy because that's just how balls should be throwed. There\u0026rsquo;s only one way that a ball could be throwed, and that\u0026rsquo;s it. or there are just these ways.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s where the name became very important. The skills are somehow considered as a sole entity in the world, although there exists very similar processes that could do same things, we needed a fixed impression, to hard-code on our memory, to make it a every instinct.\n高可扩展性和做一件事情并做得很好是两个重要的原则.\n  ",url:"https://hermanhel.github.io/braindump/daily/2022-03-17/"},"https:\/\/hermanhel.github.io\/braindump\/daily\/2022-03-21\/":{title:"2022-03-21",tags:["draft","draft"],content:"project Euler #12 I bruteforce the devisors by testing all number under root of the INPUT, A wiser approach is\napply fn main() { let max = 500; let mut n = 1; loop { if find_num_factors(make_triangle_num(n)) \u0026gt;= max { break } n += 1; } println!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;, make_triangle_num(n)); } fn make_triangle_num(n:i64) -\u0026gt; i64 { (n * (n + 1))/2 } fn find_num_factors(mut n:i64) -\u0026gt; i64 { let mut r = 1; let mut z = 2; while n \u0026gt; 1 { let mut c = 0; loop { if is_prime(z) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; n%z == 0{ c += 1; n /= z; } else { r *= c + 1; z += 1; break } } } r } fn is_prime(n:i64) -\u0026gt; bool { let mut ret = true; if n \u0026gt; 2 { for i in 2..((n as f64).sqrt() as i64)+1 { if n%i == 0 { ret = false; break } } } else if n == 0 || n == 1 { ret = false; } ret } Project Euler #13 Large sum\nplay blender!

It doesn\u0026rsquo;t worth a second claim taht I fucked up my life in the first place, or as I may say, before in time.\nAnd then, as connected by the time continuaty, I restarted Mindfulness practice. I\u0026rsquo;ll save my word for describe the feeling. but for the result, I\u0026rsquo;m calm after all.\nThe tutor have a word at me, that is the time, the present time that I dropped in to live to the fullest, is the perfect time. I save my justification for that. I like the belief, however, of the moment is made perfect by living it to the fullest when it\u0026rsquo;s still the present.\nLIVE IN THE PRESENT.\nGo Back to the breath when feel down, when feel mind torn, or when feel like it.\nLearning I have to state it another time that I learn by CREATing things, not reading.\nI learn concept by explaining it, learn method by engineering system, recording it and do according to the cheat sheet.\nI learn facts by think of them, and using them in my proof/theory/description.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s all about I use them. Somehow they get involved in my life. I invest on them. I interact with them in an intimacy more than a glance. I play with them, I twist them, I pick them up from the text, from other various places, trust them, question them, shout at them, smile at them, find them good or evil, finding them cool or boring. I mess with them. I kiss with them. I hug them. They are not strangers. They are not statues on the holy hall, not ever truth on the starry sky. They are just like me, to be respected, to be trust or distrust. It's this openness and intimacy to the reallity that I gain from learning.\nI guess it can be said that it\u0026rsquo;s my intimacy problem standing in the way of learning in this narrative.\nTools and Better tools I suggest there are better knowledge. Something General, something more powerful than that my peer and older generation know. By the power of the knowledge I am the one king of the world, and people would admire me.\nThere are knowledge that require other knowledge as prerequisite, and therefore larger in scale. but does that make them better knowledge?\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s unfair to take some random words I read on street to those that I really understanded. Once I understand the knowledges, I\u0026rsquo;ll know that they are all somehow the best knowledge(for some questions). You don\u0026rsquo;t say someone is a rubbish friend. You have all sorts of friend, and every of them is unique.\nThe General view is useless without details, the method is useless without input and output, without boundaries and selected spotlight. Things are connected, and support each other.\nSo stop treating knowledge as tools and assume the existance of better tools that make the ones you have rubbish, which in that narrative, is always true. but treat knowledge as friends. Being a old-school scholar, friend of knowledge, with bookshelves of notes and record of fact and truth, isn\u0026rsquo;t that more attractive compared to some socail media bragging guy who talk all day about how to utilize some knowledge to a extent out of it\u0026rsquo;s control. A scholar of this kind create his own calming air, making the breakfast a pleasing journey of experiance and discovery. Where that bragging guy would eventually become very annoying. Life is not some competition, but also the reward. It\u0026rsquo;s not worth it spending all the rewards to win the competition. At least in that narrative\nI get to know the stuffs. I became familiar with them. I\u0026rsquo;m a scholar. That\u0026rsquo;s my core identification I\u0026rsquo;ll repeat for clearification:\n I learn by establishing intimacy with concepts, facts, and methods.  for concepts, I explain and create my own ones with ref for facts, I use them in my creation and proof for methods, I construct them and practice them to create my own works.   I\u0026rsquo;m a scholar.  I create my own calming air I treat knowledge and skill as friends and not tools. I have fun doing what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. Always remember to have fun. Not convincing self that I\u0026rsquo;m having fun, but always remember to make the thing fun.

A normal narrative is that I do things to feel good.

A common senario is that I start watching with total freedom, where I can actively choose from several activities with similar desire rate, and continue to watch, because my mind can\u0026rsquo;t do anything else.\nThe priority and \u0026ldquo;level of fun\u0026rdquo; of watching this show was then raised to the maximum of all desires, often with my consciouse fading, and my ability to make educated thoughts and decisions declining. I now view this situation as a loss of freedom.\nThen what is freedom? In this circumstance, freedom is capability to choose from several similarly weighted options. If after doing an activity, I\u0026rsquo;m so hooked up that I countinoue on doing this without any thoughts, stopping doing make me miserable, and I don\u0026rsquo;t have any desire on anything else, then it\u0026rsquo;s functioning as drugs, stripping freedom of thinking, options, and having fun from me.

可以把session的主題寫下來,放在一眼就可以看見的地方,當要開始一個新的活動的時候就看一眼,考慮一下是不是同一個session的動作,如果不是的話,就寫到TODO list裏,之後再去做它.像是我,基本把所有事情都寫在org-roam的daily page裏面,就把dedicated session的topic寫在它的地步: dedicated session: Linear Algebra 當我要開始一個新的活動的時候,就 C-c n d t, 看一看是否符合現在的topic.當然,如果你也用emacs的話,你也可以寫一個自己的 dedicated session 函數.  對於dedicated session來說,產出最多的就是Doing的環節了!無論做了什麼有趣的事情,肯定都是在Doing的環節裏,回憶中,也都是Doing裏面美好回憶最多,畢竟Dumping和Releasing可並不是開心的緩建,而是避免沮喪的環節呀. 但是,也千萬不要忘記,如果沒有dumping和releasing的環節在,doing的環節就會相當地脆弱了,說不定可能一週也只會有一兩次舒服的Doing,其他時間都是在自責、懊惱、怨毒和對自己能力的不信任與自我埋汰中度過!說不定歷史上許多在才華的課題上煩惱大半輩子的藝術家,只是沒有能夠保持doing時的狀態而已呢.有時候,像是我忘記哪個中世紀的畫家一樣,「沒有模特他就不畫」,只不過,不僅僅是在沒有模特的時候不浪費時間畫畫,而且和模特們約好/搬到模特多的街區,保證自己想畫畫的時候總能找到模特,也是不錯的呢!\n音樂與酷酷的感覺 有很多人總是疑惑,在做事情的時候究竟該不該放音樂呢?有的人說放音樂會更專注,有的人說會分心,還有人和稀泥說什麼,「每個人都有各自的情況」,搞得人頭大,不知道怎樣做好.\nScott Young的新書 Ultralearning 中關於 Focus 的章節提到,關於環境中「聲音」的因素,在實驗中發現和人「疲憊」的程度一起作用影響 Focus, 在人累的時候聲音大點好,人不累的時候聲音小點好.\n但是很多時候我們也不只是把背景音聲作為Focus的激活劑,而是覺得這樣「這樣很酷」,能夠營造酷酷的氛圍,讓我們有自己正在做酷酷的事情的感覺.\n我覺得這種感覺,也是十分重要的!如果自己並不是在做酷酷的事情,那當更酷的事情出現,自然就會想要分心去做更酷的事情,「不在無聊的事情上浪費人生」嘛!只有已經稍微滿足自己當下session的酷酷程度,才能安心下來做事,對突然襲來的念頭有抵抗力.想想,如果你在辦公室裡做很無聊的事情,突然樓下發生車禍,當然會很想去圍觀吧?但如果你正在實驗室進行可能改變領域現狀的實驗,即使是同事出車禍都未必能奪過你的注意力吧?\n所以,我覺得,如果你想要放音樂,僅僅是因為這樣酷酷的,那就是很充足的理由了!應該把這一條寫進憲法,「人生來有追求酷酷的狀態的權利」!\n不過,在曲目的選擇上,出了保證曲子酷酷的之外,最好還是避開自己聽得懂的曲子,比如說流行歌曲啊,或者比較爛大街的旋律啊,因為它們實在是太容易讓人想起和它們相關的回憶了!一不小心就會因為過去的記憶淚流滿面!一定要小心避開 Adele 的歌!\n如果是我的話,我有時會在doing的時候放一些 Hard Bop 的爵士樂,特別是一些我沒聽過,一點也不熟,連旋律還是即興都分不清的. 我特別喜歡 Charlie Parker 的 Anthropology, 但是如果在doing的時候放,一不小心就跟著唱起來了,就沒辦法放了. 或者,像 Thelonious Monk 這樣,反正也記不住他彈些什麼鬼東西的,熟悉的曲子倒也沒太大關係. 快的速度和節奏還會讓腦袋感覺興奮呢!\n退後一步的機會 計畫是很重要的,但是很多時候一些計畫往往依賴一些沒有獲取,暫時也不知道怎麼獲取的知識,就只能夠走一步看一步.在這種時候,休息給了一個很好的「退後一步的機會」. 我在做這個網站的時候,參考了jethro kuan的braindump.我看到他那個網站很酷,也很符合我想要的樣子,就想「就學他做網站的辦法吧?」,因為他有發布網站的源碼.他使用ox-hugo,和hugo這兩個工具做的.我一開始什麼都不懂,感覺「用org-roam的文件夾一下子就生成這個網站了!」好像是魔法一樣.因為沒用過hugo,也看不大懂他倉庫裏都是什麼東西,頭就大起來,中途放棄了好多次.後來有一次我刪來刪去做實驗,終於快要成功,但是emacs 在terminal裏運行batch mode總是不成功,就難受很久.再然後我就去做了一遍hugo的quickstart,還是沒有頭緒.各種信息在我腦子裡轉轉,但是沒有辦法連結出一個能夠成功設置這個網站的辦法.在之後休息的時候,我重新想了想hugo和ox-hugo的機理,突然發現,我把org文件都用hugo轉成md之後,存到content裏面,然後運行hugo做好public,把public傳到GitHub上面,好像就直接deploy成功了.結果也確實是這樣.\nReleasing 不僅是在doing開始的時候要好好地放開之前的事情,在doing結束的時候,也要好好地放開.在Releasing時,要做的事有:\n Log 把做下的工作簡述寫入log,可以給人round up的感覺,同時也可以清晰地做出一個本身完全的總結給之後使用,防止之後需要相關信息的時候要再次進入這個session的context. 放鬆 和dumping的過程大致上類似.  結束的時候不要急著走!要好好收工才行.使用dedicated session的一個好處就是在於,當附近時間都在一個主題周圍時,後來的時間相比最開始的時間將會更加輕鬆,這是得益於context.而如果在doing之後不release,直接去買菜,或者做運動,相當於這個context一直持續下去,卻加入了不相關的信息.這就像本來給一個工作計時,但是等到結束之後好久才想起來停止,完全不知道計時的哪一部分是這份工作,哪一部分不是. 在不release的情況下一直繼續,但是沒有了doing的小節管理,很容易就會進入混亂狀態,而程式化地release過,就能夠比較好地管理,能夠保留精力提醒自己下一個dedicated session要dump先.值得一提的是,僅僅是複述一遍做過的事情,就足夠給人很強的結束和安心感,而如果不這麼做,它們很傾向於一直懸在空中,給後來的session一個context無關的tension.我想,這可能是因為人果然還是需要先陳述過來認識一個事務,才能著手理智地處理它.\ndumping的方法 發現新快捷鍵!

To play good jazz piano, you need to play at least 1 other instrumment. Bass, Harp, and Guitar are usually popular choices. Drum is not always a popular second instrument, but it\u0026rsquo;s also a good one.\nOne reason you need another instrument is that Jazz music is of interaction. Piano\u0026rsquo;s having very unique logic, you need to understand other instrument. A good way is to play one.\nAnother good reason is that, piano\u0026rsquo;s logic is kind of disguising. You could play 7 or 8 notes together, all the sounds, without knowing them. A Bass, on the other hand, plays only base and its own solo, Harp too. The switch of logic provide comparison that could guide you to avoid unconscious playing, and make things more fun.\n  Database(songs) Singer Database(songs)   Besame Mucho\n  Lyrics\nbésame, bésame mucho,\ncomo si fuera esta noche la última vez,\nbésame, bésame mucho,\nque tango miedo a perderte perderte después\nbésame, bésame mucho,\ncomo si fuera esta la última vez,\nbésame, bésame mucho,\nque tango miedo a perderte, perderte después\nquiero tenerte muy cerca mirarme en tus ojos verte junto a mí\npiensa que tal vez mañana yo ya estaré lejos, muy lejos deti\nbésame, bésame mucho\ncomo si fuera esta noche la última vez.\nbésame, bésame mucho\nque tango miedo a perderte, perderte después\n    Harmony\nOn G, but alt 3.(3 b on G) A -\n      Hotel California\n  Lyrics\nOn a dark desert highway\nCool wind in my hair\nWarm smell of colitas\nRising up through the air\nUp ahead in the distance\nI saw a shimmering light\nmy head grew heavy and my sight grew dim\nI had to stop for the night\nThere she stood in the doorway\nI heard the mission bell\nANd I was thinking to myself this could be heaven or this could be hell\nThen she lit up a candle\nAnd she showed me the way.\nThere were voices down the corridor,\nI thought I head them say\n     Sweet Vitory  ",url:"https://hermanhel.github.io/braindump/main/20211008134350-artist/"},"https:\/\/hermanhel.github.io\/braindump\/main\/20211018153044-assembly_programming\/":{title:"Assembly Programming",tags:[],content:"I started assembly programming after a major crash of inline assembly in C++.\nSpecifications OS X assembly in macOS-stackoverflow OS X require that stack pointer have 16-byte alignment at the point of any external function call\n.cstring _hello: .asciz \u0026#34;Hello, world\\n\u0026#34; .text .globl _main _main:cmdline sub $8, %rsp // align rsp to 16B boundary mov $0, %rax lea _hello(%rip), %rdi // load address of format string call _printf // call printf add $8, %rsp // restore rsp ret Syntax Masm   Structure\n.data .code     Data Declare\n.data count BYTE 100 wVal WORD 2 bVal2 BYTE ?

I define skill as machine, and mastering a skill as being familiar with the machine. so the system would make it easy to obtain new skills, and formalize the existing skills.\nI see this system something like the lisp, or emacs it self: a small compiler, and a fully extensible system, where the system contains only the compiler at first, but using the compiler, various packages could be pluged in to the system, make it really huge and powerful with time.\nIn this analogy, if skill = machine, then a system like that that work with machine, would be a machine as the\u0026hellip;\nthe key defference here is that for a compiler, it\u0026rsquo;s executed by natural law. And human\u0026rsquo;s acting a machine involves lots of decision, with emphasis on construction and familiarence\nThe compiler way may be unrealistic. but it\u0026rsquo;s a option\nThe other option is the extensible language approach, In which, the fundamental computing is implemented, and macros can be defined to use these features. This is, make a set of very simple machines that implement basic behaviours, like:\n read machine consturction the log utility should be included in the construction machine, not session. the session are meant to be very small to be managable and boost focus. There then would be too many logs with few really content. Should just note randomly at session, and log formally in the machine specified log utility. machine familiarence aquisition memorize things understand direct practice sport As a whole I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of a work-out plan. It\u0026rsquo;s impossible to have a very large plan scheduled to every hour, and no chance I\u0026rsquo;ll go through that right accordingly. session note randomly  Then, for further machines, could use these machines as facility. like in a project machine to take a cource, could (do (read material) (machine-construct specification) (machine-familiarence-aquire 上一个machine)) . Or combine them into a new machine, read-skill-aquire.\nIf treat machine like function, then can\u0026rsquo;t skip macro. The key difference between macro and function is function is recursively executed and macro is transforming the instruction, and then call functions. In term of machine, is whether to (function) go through the inner procedure 1 by 1 or (macro) first transform the input.\nmanage skills as machines Skills sound like very static thing, with same input and output, and no integration to other fields, except when learning a new skill. If manage skill as machines, the integration could be simpler to think about, and the skill could be simpler to deal with(develop, maintain, apply), because it\u0026rsquo;s been formally defined.\nNeuralscientist I always remember that I wanted to be a neuroscientist, and read related materials to gain knowledge when available.\nTopics Blender Bondage/Knots Learning CPT104 OS Maintain the good credit machine.

Often, the thinker would take the position of consumer or employee.\nTransaction A classic definition of transaction is exchange of matter between entities, usually with reference to modern business, where money and product are exchanged between people.\nCentering Transaction Input-output and output-input consumer-oriented thinking focuses on relation of input and output.\nTraditionally, the input-output relation are often refered as consequence knowledge, base on which prediction could be made from previous experiance of similar input.\nNow ,COT emphasize on the output, and use the output to evaluate the whole process.\nGaining A typical proposition of COT is how much I have gained from this activity. Similarly, the accumulated result of activities are examined by COT as important standard of evaluation of people.\nThe reason was considered to lie in the implicit product identity. COT consider everything as product that would involve in a trade some day. The ultimate goal is to gain as much of value from that transection. The definition of the trade is vague and not specific to 1 target, but always being bore in mind.\nexamples are:\n Time is money in exchange of time, we got the skill in exchange of effort, we got the payment   The best product From marketing COT borrowes the idea of comparison between product. The goal is to make the product the best product, with high quality in market or high share in market.\nSimple standard with attributed evaluation like \u0026ldquo;time/speed\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;accuracy\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;maximum power\u0026rdquo; are used by COT to evaluate whether a product is good.\nRight and wrong and better COT take thoughts for granted, and usually with a small space. There\u0026rsquo;s 1 thinking, and 1 thinking great, like \u0026ldquo;8 bottle of water 1 day\u0026rdquo;, but with no further comment.\n\u0026ldquo;This thinking sounds right and sane, so I could use it to prove myself honorable. By assuming this idea true I gain priviledge/advantage over other people.\u0026rdquo;\nTherefore, the process of evaluating ideas is:\n to normal default:  evaluating truth by logic, truth set and evident evaluating turth by tradition or faith   to COT default:  selecting 1 idea product in the idea supermarket.  myself being a consumer, so no modification to idea, but selection. no creation or self generating ideas, being consumer select 1 idea that\u0026rsquo;s the greatest bargain   using libraries in machine learning  test libraries for best score. no modification to libraries, being a consumer. little self written function/code, being a consumer.

A less reliable extra information is that if multipled with the frequency of buying counterfeit products collected from the sample, the overall frequency of sample purchasing counterfeit product is 25.1%.

That is to say, for these 42.1% of all people, counterfeit product had become not only a presence, but an option, that would be deliberately considered. With these numbers, it is revealed that not only is counterfeit product very common to be seen, there are actually large portion people actively seeking to see and purchase them.

Data was obtained from 102 university students using an online questionnaire, and simple statistics were used to analyze the results. The findings demonstrate that counterfeit products are common among university students, with a high percentage of them actively purchasing counterfeits. Factors such as overpriced genuine product and expensive defense costs are examined.\n    Introduction\n  Background\nCounterfeit products have been a huge commercial issue for a long time, and the mechanism that allows them to persist is fascinating. The behavior of university students in regards to counterfeit products was investigated in this research in order to better understand the factors that contribute to the widespread prevalence of counterfeit goods.\n    Literature Review\nThe flow of counterfeit items can be divided into two types: non-deceptive and deceptive, with the difference being whether or not the consumers were aware of the products' counterfeit nature (Grossman and Shapiro, 1988).\nPrevious studies looked into a range of elements that seem to have a significance in counterfeiting, which may be classified into three categories: psychographic factors, demographic factors, and product factors (Wee, Tan and Cheok, 1995; Michaelidou, 2011). (Christodoulides and Michaelidou, 2011)\nProduct attributes were often regarded as the most important factor contributing to counterfeiting. Singh and Kumar argued that the marketing of counterfeit products, such as lowering the price to an accessible level and ensuring high availability and localisation of the counterfeits, has made counterfeits quite popular in rural India (Singh and Kumar, 2017). Product type was also investigated to see if it had a high correlation with individuals purchasing counterfeits, resulting in an obvious preference for counterfeit experiential products over symbolic products (Michaelidou and Christodoulides, 2011).Aside from that, researchers discovered that the low price and high quality of counterfeit items, like other regular things, would have a favorable influence on their purchase (Singh and Kumar, 2017). (Nik Hashim, Shah and Omar, 2018). Nonetheless, brand image has been proved to have a complicated impact on counterfeiting, with loyal customers rejecting counterfeits while counterfeit manufacturers being positively encouraged to imitate them (Nik Hashim, Shah, and Omar, 2018). (Hoang Cuu Long and Nguyen Nhat Vinh, 2017).\nIn terms of psychographic factors, the ethical obligation of the consumer was commonly seen as a determinant. According to Michaelidou, luxury counterfeits may be rejected owing to consumers' ethical obligations, whereas experiential items such as music or films may be allowed (Michaelidou and Christodoulides, 2011). Eisend and Quoquab conducted similar consistent researches. (2017) (Quoquab et al) (Eisend, 2019). Consumer purchasing attitudes were also considered a factor in counterfeiting, particularly with regard to the relationship between hedonic attitude and garment purchase (Moon et al., 2018) Nguyen Nhat Vinh and Hoang Cuu Long (2017) Furthermore, materialism and oral communication were examined to have positive impact on counterfeiting in certain scenarios(Davidson, Nepomuceno and Laroche, 2019)(Khalid and Rahman, 2015)\n    Aims and Hypotheses\nThe goal of this study is to comprehend the current state of counterfeit items and how they got to be that way. The following research questions would be examined in particular: how widespread is counterfeit product in the sample; how many of the sample were aware of purchasing counterfeit items; and what reasons contribute to the problem. Our hypothesis for these questions are as follows: counterfeit items are quite common in the sample; many of the sample were aware of purchasing counterfeit products; and a range of factors, including vanity and sample preferences, were involved.\n      Methododology\n  Sample\nThe sample size is 102 persons, 46 males and 56 females chosen at random from all XJTLU students.\n    Materials\nA questionaire of ten questions is employed, with a range of question types such as multichoice questions, yes/no questions, scaling questions, and open questions. Questionairs are created using Wenjuanxin.com and delivered over WeChat during the procedure. Jupyter notebook, Python, and several libraries such as matplotlib and numpy are used for data analysis and visualization.\n    Procedure\nWe initially proposed the study questions and hypotheses throughout the survey. Based on the hypotheses, we identified several discriptive features of the targets that seem to be relevant in terms of counterfeit goods purchase among XJTLU students. Then, questionnaires are designed to collect data on these features. They are then distributed online. After receiving the data, the distributive features are examined first. Multiple characteristics would then be shown in pairs to check whether there is any evidence of relationship.\n      Results and Discussion\n  Finding 1: Prevalence\nCounterfeit items are quite common among university students. Only 23.5 percent of those polled said they had never purchased a counterfeit goods. The remaining 76.4 percent admit to having purchased counterfeit goods at least once. That is, the bulk of the sample buys counterfeit items as an experience, either consciously or unintentionally. A less credible piece of information is that when the frequency of them purchasing counterfeit items is multiplied, general frequency of the sample purchasing counterfeit products is 25.1 percent. That is, one out of every four items purchased by university students will be counterfeit.\n    Finding 2: Awareness\nThe percentage of university students being aware that they are purchasing counterfeit goods is pretty high.\nAccording to the data, 42.1 percent of the sample were aware of the counterfeit feature of their products and opted to acquire them knowing full about it. If we reduce the sample size from the whole sample space to simply those who believed they had purchased a counterfeit goods, the figure could be as high as 55%.\nThat is, for this 42.1 percent of all consumers, counterfeit product has become more than just a presence, but also an intentional consideration, which is consistent with Eisend\u0026rsquo;s findings (Eisend, 2019).\nWith these figures, it is clear that not only are counterfeit products widely available, but a sizable proportion of people deliberately seek to see and purchase them.\nThe second question is, \u0026ldquo;What is it that is causing this situation?\u0026rdquo;\n    Finding 3:\n  Easy access\nIt was determined that the counterfeit items were obtained exclusively from Taobao.com, an online shopping site that dominates the sample shopping form. Possiblitie could be derived that the easy availability of counterfeits have encouraged university students to purchase them.\n    Reason\nAnother indicator is that over 28% of students believe that certain authentic products have exorbitant prices and are not worth purchasing. When such needs exists and certain \u0026ldquo;alternatives\u0026rdquo; emerge with affordable pricing and comparable capabilities, it seems obvious that these alternatives should be given more consideration. The student\u0026rsquo;s independent pricing judge also demonstrates an ethical conflict between them and the brands, which supports Lysonski\u0026rsquo;s discovery that customers might occasionally claim the innocence of counterfeits (Lysonski and Durvasula 2008). Meanwhile, with over 55% of the sample believing that they would never take action against counterfeit items owing to the significant expense of protecting their rights, both in time and money, the low risk of making counterfeit products might be a factor contributing to the issue.\n        Conclusion\n  Summary of Findings\nCounterfeit items appeared to be highly common among university students, with a high level of awareness of them. Factors contributing to this issue include the ease with which counterfeit items may be obtained, the exorbitant prices of certain brands, the enormous expense of protecting their rights, and the durability of counterfeit products.\n    Limitations\nThis study use questionnaires to elicit the sample\u0026rsquo;s subjective self-description. Individual findings may be erroneous or ambiguous owing to misinterpretation of the questions or of themselves. Furthermore, this study was conducted on a per-student basis, which implies that while the outcome is stactical and quantitative, the true characteristic of the outcome is qualitative, with a limited view on the level of each feature.\n    Recommendation\nDespite the large level of support for boycotting, it appears that counterfeit items will not be easily eliminated. As long as the ground feeding counterfeit items persists—exorbitant pricing, excessive costs of right defending—the room of counterfeit product will always be spared and never empty. As a result, in order to eliminate counterfeit items, companies should evaluate their pricing and product quality.Social groups that reduce the expense of protecting one\u0026rsquo;s rights in the context of counterfeit products would also be beneficial.\n    Future Research\nFuture research with multiple ways to measure the scale of counterfeit product use or purchase would be recommended.\n    TODOReference Finding TODOTaobao having much counterfeit product references    TODOGraphs Prevalence Speaking test Content    presentation   introduce the survey project briefly Describe interesting results  use \u0026gt;=1 graph   Recommend ways to improve the project based on the results presented Conclude the presentation with a conclusion  Requirements\n 5 minutes Finish within 5 minutes      interview  a interview \u0026lt;= 5 minutes including:\n Questions about presentation/survey/giving a presentation Reflection on EAP Skills questions related to TED TALks in this semester  Power of smiling Half a million secrets How to listen Technology work buddies    Requirements:\n at least 3 questions       Organization  intro   body   conclusion  Technique   idiomatic language\nuse image to convey idea\n  Visual   Impact\n  Number simplification\nThe most critical number and number part(17% instead of 18283849 people)\n    TODOSpeaking test preparation TODOMake slides   Generating Visuals\n  Charts [5/5] Prevalence Awareness Access Reasons Right Defending      Image\n Counterfeit TAOBAO Famous Brand Product Right Protection      TODOQuestion scenario   already covered question\nThanks for your question,Just like what I have said before\n   off topic/Too complex    Not shure\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have that information now To be honest, I don\u0026rsquo;t know it exactly\n    Don\u0026rsquo;t understand the questions\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t catch that\u0026hellip; could you repeat the question?

I look forward to how the book would make it concrete and hands-on\nAnd Part II introducing the tools, covering simple usage of UNIX R Python and MySQL in his data analyse process.\nIt seems that the author use R as primary language of data analysis. The Part III go through several algorithms of supervised and unsupervised classifier training using R.\nAnd the Part IV get into real problems with using API to get data, and analyse them. Then talk about how to choose/evaluate methods\n Therefore I suggest a very quick overview of everything in Part I, and just go to the tests. Afterwards, could play with the tools a little bit, but I guess it won\u0026rsquo;t be long since I have known UNIX, python, and pretty much of MySQL, and how to learn a new language. Followed by Part III, it could be tricky, but I see it didn\u0026rsquo;t involve much math, yet still long, so I guess he might have been doing a great job in explaining it. There\u0026rsquo;s still practices I could reflex upon, so no worry. Apply the solving problem application of Feynman Techinique and I\u0026rsquo;ll be well tended. And the Part IV could be very fun because of the real world involed in, and very troublesome, because real world is.

I have well working memory and a very small amont of register.\n  Account\n  Disadvantage\n  Constant/continueous converging.\nMy working memory contains 1 things for most. That means if the place was hold by [a task/a desire(like sex)/a strategy[for game]/.etc], there will be no room for my moral, principle, goals, or background awareness.\nThe result is me converging to the first things I saw in a session.\nIf I saw a vim documentation, I would start testing vim; if I have a snack in front of me, I would start eating; if there's a game in front of me, I would start playing; if there's a atmosphere in the room, I would blend in. My time would therefore be used unaware. There would be no time for important things, because this feature tends to do urgent things and urgent things only, and I won\u0026rsquo;t be remembering to think about a wiser option. I would do things stupidly, either converging to atmosphere of the room or my nature against my principle.\n      Advantages\n  Focus\nI would be very focused on concepts at hand. Understanding and precision would be piece of cake.\n        Solution\n  Crutch\n  Procedural check\nA whole procedure on a piece of paper would work. A step in the General task doing machine to check for principles and goals\n    Mnemonic\nSet mnemonic for key figures. Door\u0026ndash;entering the door and remember the social principles\u0026ndash;a small story about door and my social principles like jigsaws\n      Practice\nWhen I have practiced and got familiar with the principles or tasks I should bare in mind, they would be naturally out with ease.\n  Example\n玩云顶之弈时，拿到什么英雄，什么装备，可以组成什么阵容，还需要什么英雄和装备，甚至海克斯强化，在一开始看着攻略打的时候是记不得的。但是重复两三次之后就不需要再看攻略了。\n      Review\nFrequently review on my deeds, record, goals, schemes and such. Spaced repetition meaning also, but review here mainly refer to my own decision and thoughts. I of course wish to remember all knowledge, but as I can refer to them in my notes, My OWN DECISION and OWN THOUGHTS are more important, as I\u0026rsquo;ll use and live out them everyday.\n    Goals Accomplishing my Roles I have many roles, of them the most important are four:\n Neuralscientist Artist Engineer Athlete  Study interest Neuroscience I\u0026rsquo;m interested in the way memory and conscious work, and is curious to building an agent that could grow like a human.\nAlso interested in capturing and injecting sence/information out of/from brain. Like Fully immersed experiance, remote neural control\nQuantum Computing I have a instinct that the model of conscious/StrongAI would require quantum computer architecture to realize.\nComputer Science General Model Generator, a algorithm to generate models. Neuroscience is having bottleneck developing because of lack of model. A algorithm that could generate model on its own would be of great help.\nThis could be combined with a General Model Testor, which could generate test/experiments on top of models, and/or test model with already take experiments' data.\nWay of doing things I do things according to my machines. Everything. Projects like getting grade in certain phase I do with a giant project machine, Skills and routines that would appear many times I do with normal machine.\nI call a time period dedicated to one thing session, and the thing in the session task. Generally I\u0026rsquo;m doing tasks all the time, and they all converge to the General task doing machine. This machine is dedicated to deal with my personal Weakness, espeicially My Greatest weakness of rememberance. Several moral and artful aspects are dealt, too. The machine would be carried throughout my everyday life. Exceptions are that moments I make desisions and times I think that I should listen to my nature self(reassesment), like relaxation or having fun.\nWith the General task doing machine as a base and fallback, I have machines for certain things I do, like Archery Machine for Shooting and practice of shooting and Self-Learning Machine for self-learning and review based on material without tutors.\nAnother important machine would be the Scheme machine. While According to it, the projects are nested under Artist, Engineer, Athlete, and Neuralscientist seperately, to show the relation of the project and the goal they serve to, A list of all Scheme\u0026rsquo;s and their results is maintained under the Scheme machine. It have very close relationship with my memoir and CV, personal history, which is also maintained there.\nThe last important machine in my general way of doing things is Task management machine. It take advantage of org-mode\u0026rsquo;s features like org-agenda and org-capture to construct a way where I can take task from.\nThe whole flow could be described as:\n Scheme machine make scheme machines (project plans) filled with tasks Task management machine takes the tasks from schemes and present them to me everyday and Everyday, in each session, I do the tasks with machines converging to the General task doing machine.  Of course, there will be other spontaneous actions like the making of machines, recording of cluttering tasks and logs, journals, but the main way important things are done is described in the flow above.\nWeakness troubleshooting Additionally, as my weakness is critical, a Media control machine is also critical to deal with the problem of too masive media consumption.\nBare Media control machine in mind every time with media. take log of it.\nPhysical Attributes Medical state sore shoulder     solution\n  垂头\n把头自然垂下有帮助\n      偏头\n向左侧微偏可以稍微缓解.\n    belly 有游泳圈.\n鼻炎 右手   ",url:"https://hermanhel.github.io/braindump/main/20211114195701-me_meta/"},"https:\/\/hermanhel.github.io\/braindump\/main\/20211116140319-media_consumption_project\/":{title:"Media consumption project",tags:["Peter","Boss","Secret"],content:"Literature Novels Light Serious Movie 007 series 盖里奇 困在时间里的父亲 ",url:"https://hermanhel.github.io/braindump/main/20211116140319-media_consumption_project/"},"https:\/\/hermanhel.github.io\/braindump\/main\/20211116133253-media_control_machine\/":{title:"Media control machine",tags:[],content:"Target Target of media control includes:\n Game Movie Video Music Novel Illustrat etc  Restriction Focus of Consumption of media, with no further specifiction, is less important than my goals.\nBut Medias have strong strategy implication and urges for its lasting existence.

你可能在学校里看到各种肤色和人种的老师和同学，这是完全正常的，本大学致力于打造国际化科研学习环境。在看到不熟悉外貌的老师或者同学时，请不要惊慌，或者采取喧哗、骚扰或者殴打等不当应对方式，应该像应对任何熟悉的人种，如非裔、亚裔或者欧裔师生一样应对。作为世界公民，对于多元化环境的适应是非常重要的。\n  身体器官\n本条同样适用于拥有异常身体器官的师生。本学校的设施尽量考虑了多元人群的使用，但仍可能有出于各种原因，无法合适使用学校设施的师生。请在力所能及范围内对他们谅解或帮助。\n    例外\n以上条款不适用于任何拥有XXXX和XXXXXXX的师生。如在任何时间发现具有以上特点的人员在校内逗留，请立刻通知学校物业进行处理，并尽量不被发现地离开现场，但请尽量不要离开学校。\n  政治 学校是新鲜思想的摇篮。你可以在校内除IB外的任何地点讨论任何合适的观点。校内的商店不被视作校内。如果认为观点将是不合适的，请不要在上述例外地点或校外进行讨论，否则后果自负。\n  （隐藏）限度\n学校的观点保护有着限度\n  校园 校区 XXXXX大学有且仅有一个校区。学校南端地下室为人防措施，并不通向任何其他校区，地下室尽头墙壁的另一头也并非学校的地产。 请不要相信任何关于“南校区”或者任何不属于1.3.2所述教学楼的传言。也请不要传播他们，这只会给学校管理带来困扰。 如在任何场所看见描述 “南校区”或者暗示“南校区”存在的材料，请立即通知学校物业进行处理。\n （隐藏）地下通道的墙和尽头的划痕、标语和声音  教学楼 学校现有且仅有一个基础教学楼Elementary Building，四个科学学科楼Science Building A/B/C/D，两个数学学科楼Mathematic Building A/B，一个公共教学楼Shared Building，以及两个电子学科教学楼Eelectronic Building A/B。\n图书馆 学校现有且仅有一个图书馆，位于学校中心的中心楼Middle Building东侧3-10层。请不要相信或进入任何学校内除MB内图书馆以外的图书馆附属设施，图书馆并没有设置任何其他校内阅览室。\n时间 通宵 请尽量避免在校通宵。学校的工作时段为8:00-17:00。 如特殊情况必须在校通宵，请使用特定的通宵教室。学校物业的保安会清理所有其他的教室，并驱赶所有逗留学生。他们是为了学生的安全着想，请一定听从他们的指示。 禁止在非通宵教室通宵。\n  意外情况\nz一般来说，通宵教室是安全的。学校物业的保安会定期在通宵教室检查和巡视。 当有突发意外情况时，请相信学校保安，并听从他们的指示。他们经过训练，并了解学校情况。 即使你不认为发生了任何意外情况，也请相信学校保安，并听从他们的指示。 当你在非通宵教室通宵并遇见意外情况，通宵教室的保安不能也无法保证你的安全，请不要前往通宵教室寻求帮助。请在教室隐蔽处等待险情过去。如果你希望得到帮助，请尽力前往位于校园南端的地下室。\n  寝室 校内 学校目前无任何校内寝室。任何在校内逗留至21:00以后的师生都被视为已知并在通宵条例的庇护之下。\n校外 学校人员目前使用且仅使用附近的WA，WB，WC三个大学集中宿舍。学校不提供任何其他的住宿地点。师生可以自行在校外居住。\n元素 疫情 疫情可以是谜题的解，或者线索，工具\n疫情间的封锁地段 IR地下一层停车场，SX楼的封锁门，地下广场 保安哨卡\n世界公民 世界公民可以是谜题的解，或者一个核心概念 先暂定为谜题的解。\nXXXXX大学致力培养世界公民。 任何无法成为世界公民的世界公民候选人都将成为大学的一部分（打造国际化研究学习环境），并为大学培养世界公民提供助力。（留校:)） 南校区为这些人准备。 另一种说法是，XXXXX大学本来只是普通的大学。从南校区开始的异变使学生开始变化。 另一种说法是，XXXXX大学理念中的世界公民包括在世界中的一切智慧体，包括理念体，灵体，以及地球及非地球本土有/无机生命体。 另一种说法是，XXXXX大学的理念体觉醒之后（有一个异变开始的时间点），规则和外部理念世界运行的规则开始交织。作为XXXXX大学的理念体的存在存在于所有相信“世界公民”概念的智慧体上，并以可能性的方式影响其周边世界的规则。存在感越强，则遵循XXXXX大学理念规则的可能性越高。为了延续自己的存在，XXXXX大学的理念体尝试通过认知污染的方式传播“世界公民”理念。 另一种说法是，International Building IB有一切问题的答案。包括 “世界公民”的真相。\nXXXXX大学的成员 由中国的X市XX大学和英国的Kidneylake大学合办。在两边的校园都有异变产生。 大学逐渐开始沟通除了人类之外的智慧体。所有大学成员将会为 “世界公民” 而非 “世界部分公民” 的理念身份准备。从原则上来说，唯一离开大学的条件是成为 “世界公民” 。任何不满足条件的成员都将被困在大学内部，或者不断回到大学。经过时间越长，成员就会越将自己认知为大学的一部分。”“世界公民” 身份和 ”“大学”的存在是相辅相成的，所以大学不会将所有人都困在大学内部，也不会把所有人都放走。 所有大学成员都会把各自认知为合理的大学成员。无法进行此类认知的大学成员将会被处理。\n世界规则 外部理念世界是一个大的理念世界框架。整个世界由理念体构成。XXXXX大学的 “世界公民” 理念与理念世界的 “世界” 理念相调谐，引发理念规则改变和认知习惯形成。世界是一个更大的 “大学”。\n  时空逻辑\n世界的状态是无限的。每一个世界的状态都是无尽的世界状态可能海洋中的一滴随机的水。 理念是生活在状态中的生物。这意味着理念的生命是连续而不连续的。理念的生命部分和片段都是海洋中不相关的水滴，因为理念而相连接。不同维度的理念相互交织，在概率影响下决定对于当前状态下的下一状态。客观来讲，所有状态都是同时存在的，但是在理念的载体的感受角度因为理念的规则存在先后。\n因此，存在时空的倒错和以理念为参照的时空不连续、人的时空感受异常现象。比如，大学是在2008年成立的，今年是2021年。但是会存在1805年大学存在的证据。或者突然的存在消失和再现。\n外部理念世界就是其中一个很大的理念体。大学是一个小一些的理念体，世界公民是在”“外部理念世界”下的一个理念体。\n  非日常的日常现象\n  死亡\n死亡是特殊存在。死亡在所有的状态中，只有一个。而无数的规则，从无数的状态中指向死亡。 死亡是意识和存在的消亡，是意识的终结。作为概率平铺下一直存在的死亡。 在规则过于逆反的情况下，突然的「死亡」是世界中一直发生的可能性。从概率的角度来说，死亡的概率是最高的。死亡是一直存在的可能性。 不可言说的非真实状态，突然的死亡，是规则矛盾下的可能结果。\n   愧疚   缺憾      组成部分的理念与理念的强弱\n如果一些组成部分所「相信」的理念相互一致，那么它们所组成的整体会导致环境中规则的扭曲。像万有引力，但是扭曲的是「规则场」。\n所以，为了使得大学的物理存在拥有力量和延续存在，大学会将部分处于大学控制范围内的物体（器材，学生，消耗品）逐渐转化为「大学的本身」。包括且不限于器材，建筑，景观，以及空气和空气成分。部分\n  例子\n 学校内的食物不能吃。食堂的新鲜菜可以吃。不要在学校存放将要摄入的食物。 多外出进行有氧运动。        董事会的目的\n董事会是「世界公民」的集体。为了世界公民理念的存在，合办了「大学」。关于「大学源头」则没有过多的介绍。 放任大学自由生长，只会生长完美的「大学」的存在，但是这和「世界公民」存在不完全符合，所以需要让一些人能够通过大学，成为外界的「世界公民」。为此进行的修改，在大学和师生中都是有的，师生中就是「守则」，大学上则是 一些机制的修改 理念体可以直接在思念体内几乎无害地存在。但在无思念体中会无限制地外侵。董事会利用了大学，同时也限制大学的发展。\n值得指出的是，无论是「世界公民」理念体还是「大学源头」，都比大学的历史，董事会的历史，民族概念的历史，或者人类存在的历史要长得多了。\n    来源\n一开始位于FB中某个位置的「大学源头」。后来转移到IR楼顶（学校最高的位置）。\n    关于“世界公民” 在外界的组织 由于 ”“母校情结”，大学被认知为”“和校舍相关的存在”所以无法自如移动位置。在外界的“世界公民”可以行动为大学理念的分散体\n  反对组织\n“世界公民”意识因为其高传染性和潜在危险程度，受到多方组织警惕和调查。自2014年起世界公民在世界各地的数量稳定显著增多（2021年还扩招了）。反对组织对其存在进行调查。\n    世界公民组织\n世界公民理念体的目标有且只有一个：持续自己的存在。世界公民理念体和大学理念体是共生存在。失去一方，另一方会很快死亡。世界公民理念体和大学理念体不是唯一的，但是独特的。每一个理念体都有自己细微的独特处，但是存在相似可容的理念体。相似理念体的携带者聚集并交流的场所，共同理念规则的概率会升高。\n  电子邮件 电子邮件的格式。 幽灵电子邮件\nLMO LMO是\n太仓校区
